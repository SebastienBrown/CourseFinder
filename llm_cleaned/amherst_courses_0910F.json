    "description": "More than any other nation, the United States has envisioned itself as a landscape of pure possibility. From the 17th century to the present, an ever-shifting 'American Dream' has been the repository of Americans' longing for a new kind of personal and national life. In this class we will consider how Americans have imagined this new life as manifested in forms as varied as political action made possible under the Constitution to opportunities for home ownership made possible (or impossible) by the free market. Since the class introduces students to the field of American Studies, there will be considerable attention paid to different disciplinary approaches to American society and culture. Although there may be occasional exceptions, texts will consist mainly of whole books such as Frederick Douglass's autobiography, Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby, Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God, Miller's Death of a Salesman, and Roth's The Human Stain.",

    "description": "From the advertising copy and backdrop of truck ads to the democratic rhetoric of politicians, the West as a place of national mythology still permeates American culture. In this course, we will analyze the evolution of the West as a prominent site of American myth and the contemporary representations of it in literature and film, the Neo-Westerns. Students will read works by authors such as Annie Proulx, Cormac McCarthy, Sherman Alexi and Percival Everett, as well as view recent popular films by Ang Lee, Clint Eastwood, and John Sayles. The course will also include readings in history, as well as other disciplines, to contextualize the creative works and to gauge how the myth of the West compares to its reality and how truly revisionist its most current representations are.",

    "description": "This course focuses on the political, economic, ideological, social, and cultural dimensions of migration from South Asia to the United States, to be understood within the larger context of South Asian diaspora (hi)stories. Our approach will be interdisciplinary, working with social theory and history as well as literature, film, and music. We will identify different notions of diaspora and migration and how they give meaning to 'home,' and displacement. The semester begins with Indian labor migration with the system of British colonial indenture, proceeds through the 'free' labor migration of workers in the colonial and post-colonial period, and concludes with our contemporary moment.",

    "description": "(Offered as Anthropology 10 and Sociology 10.) The aim of this course is to provide an introduction to the central concepts and themes in the disciplines of anthropology and sociology. Anthropology and sociology emerged as distinct modes of inquiry in 19th-century Europe in response to several centuries of disorienting change. Monarchies were collapsing, economies were industrializing, modern science was emerging, and democratic aspirations were rising. Alongside this flux, Europes imperial reach had revealed a mind-boggling variety of cultures, each ordered and disordered in dramatically different ways. In this context, it is not surprising that two questions became urgent: Why do some societies change while others appear to be unchanging? When a society undergoes change, how does social order get re-established? These classic questions have long since been reframed to confront a fundamental challenge that we live with today: Why do people do what they do, and why do different people do things differently? This course is intended to introduce students to the ways anthropologists and sociologists continue to grapple with these critical questions. While the course will touch upon classic works from the two disciplines, it will largely focus on the ways these questions have given rise to new and often surprising answers. In exploring the ways humans make sense of and produce unique social worlds, the course will highlight points of convergence and divergence in regard to theory, formulation of research problems, and methods within the two disciplines.",
