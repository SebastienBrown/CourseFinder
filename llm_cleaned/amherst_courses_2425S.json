    "description": "The course is an interdisciplinary, historically organized study of American perceptions of and attitudes towards the human body in a variety of media, ranging from medical and legal documents to poetry and novels, the visual arts, film, and dance. Among the topics to be discussed are the physical performance of gender; the social construction of the ideal male and female body; health reform movements; athletic achievement as an instrumentalization of the body; commercialization of physical beauty in the fitness and fashion industries; eating disorders as cultural phenomena; the interminable abortion controversy; the equally interminable conflict over pornography and the limits of free speech; and adaptations to the possibility of serious illness and to the certainty of death. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on discussion, reading, written work, critical analysis; exposure to various American Studies readings, ranging from the early 19th century to the present; and the use of various methods, including interpreting historical, sociological and other scholarly work, as well as poems, novels, films, photographs, and paintings (encountered at the Mead Art Museum).",

As we study how politics has successfully deployed popular culture as an ideological tool, we will also consider how politics has overburdened popular culture as a vehicle of change. These broad issues will serve as our framework for analyzing black femininity, womanhood, and the efficacy of the word feminism in the post-Civil Rights era. We will think critically about the construction of gender, race, sexuality, and class identity as well as the historical and sociopolitical context for cultural icons and phenomena. Students will read cultural theory, essays, fiction as well as listen to, and watch various forms of media. Expectations include three writing/visual projects as well as a group presentation. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings, oral presentations, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, artistic work, field work or trips, visual analysis and aural analysis.",

    "description": "Who is an Afro-Latino? Are they Latinos or are they Black? Afro-Latinos are African-descended peoples from Latin America and the Caribbean who reside in the United States. In this course, a focus on Afro-Latinos allows us to study the history of racial ideologies and racial formation in the Americas. We take a multi-layered approach to the study of modern Afro-Latino history (late nineteenth century to the twentieth century). First, the history of Afro-Latinos has been shaped by the historical relationship between race and nation in Latin America. Therefore, we look closely at the varied histories of African-descended peoples in Latin American countries. Second, the historical relationship between the United States and Latin America has shaped the experience of Afro-Latinos who reside in the U.S. The long history of U.S. economic dominance and military interventions in Latin America and the Caribbean generated an equally long history of Latin American migration to the U.S. In the twentieth century black migrants came from nations that promoted myths of racial democracy to a nation that practiced racial segregation and violence. Afro-Latino migrants experienced racial segregation and violence in the U.S. in ways similar to but different than other Latinos and African Americans. Therefore, third, we examine the history of Afro-Latinos in relation to Latinos in the U.S. The history of Latinos is at the core of U.S. continental expansion, labor practices, and exclusionary citizenship. The category Latino has also been shaped by racial hierarchies. The relatively new category of Afro-Latino allows us to examine a history that has been silenced within the broader categories of Latino or African American. In this course, we examine how Afro-Latinos maneuvered between different racial contexts in Latin American nations and the United States. It is a history that highlights the competing and conflicting racial ideologies that have shaped the Americas. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings, and independent research.",

    "description": "In 2015 the Pew Research Center identified mixed-race Americans as the cutting edge of social and demographic change in the US. Prior to that, revisions to the United States Census in 2000 enabled the checking of multiple identity boxes, increasing the visibility of mixed-race people. Despite this recent recognition, the fact of mixed-race peoples in the Americas is nothing new. Since the Colonial period, laws governing citizenship, marriage and rights prohibited or punished miscegenation; yet, mixed-race people proliferated. Representations of and designations for racial mixing focused on negative conceptions of blood and degeneracy. In more recent decades, mixed-race people have claimed their hybridity, renamed themselves, and even declared their own Bill of Rights. Using an interdisciplinary approach, the course will examine mixed-race identity through a range of materials: legal cases, history, ethnography, visual art, literature, and critical theory. The course will also include material on transnational, transracial adoptions, and the mixed-race households they engender. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Writing and collaborating are central practices and goals in this course. Students will write regularly--during class sessions, reflecting on discussions and course materials, composing short essays, and reporting on research.

    "description": "(before 1800) This course starts with a simple premise: American Literature cannot be contained. Rather than a subject to be mastered, it is an ongoing dialogue. Practicing a relational, intertextual and interdisciplinary method of reading across genres and time periods, we will read Wheatleys Poems on Various Subjects (1773) alongside Allison Clarkes Phillis (2020) and Erdrichs Books and Islands in Ojibwe Country (2014) in dialogue with John Tanners captivity narrative (1830). Recognizing that democracy entails putting multiple perspectives and interpretations into dialogue, we will discuss a diverse range of texts that invite divergent interpretations, such as Apesss Eulogy on King Philip (1836), which speaks back to Puritan narratives; Douglasss Fourth of July speech (1852), juxtaposed with two drafts of the Declaration of Independence; and Abigail Adams correspondence with John Adams, in which she implored him to remember the ladies. We will also create literature through intergenerational storytelling with Ancestral Bridges, an organization engaged in the recovery of Afro-Indigenous history in Amherst. We will meet regularly with partners from Ancestral Bridges to develop projects that weave together oral history, place-based learning, and document transcription. Scaffolded assignments will lead to the final collaborative project. Fulfills the pre-1900 requirement in American Studies, the pre-1800 requirement in English and the Community Based Learning requirement in American Studies.

At once marginalized and woefully unspecific, Asian American identity seems to occupy a purgatorial status in the American racial imagination. How have Asian Americans been understood within, and how do they understand themselves within, white institutions, anti-black hierarchies, and capitalist orders? And what are the cumulative psychic effects of their quotidian, uneventful, and often unspoken racializations? The course begins by engaging a variety of historical events, social movements, racialized imaginaries to consider how Asian American history is vitally shaped by not only repression and assimilation, but also radicalism and innovation. From this foundation, we then examine how Asian American writers, artists, and thinkers reckon with in/visibility, ambiguity, and the minor intensities of Asian American life through stories, poetry, film, and visual art. We will engage in close reading and analysis of these materials, with an eye toward their specific social, historical, and political contexts as we read them alongside a range of critical theory on the politics of identity and subjectivity.",

This course enables students to contribute to the robust interdisciplinary and transnational research agenda of the Black Feminist Reproductive Justice, Equity, and HIV/AIDS Activism (BREHA) Lab that bridges the medical humanities, social sciences, and hard sciences. In this shared research project, students will be able to more clearly define new modes of inquiries on racism, gender, class, sexuality, and health that engage intersecting arenas of scholarship and activism, including the medicalization of race, feminist health studies, reproductive justice, and disability studies. To this end, we explore several questions: What is a black feminist approach to health among Afro-diasporic peoples and communities? What are the key terms, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, and political stakes associated with a BFHSS field? How can BFHSS expand our collective research inquiries on wellness, inequality, and society? Finally, how can this field contribute to broader efforts for social justice concerning the health, wellness, and longevity of the most vulnerable communities?

A 2018 study by the Cooperative Childrens Book Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that of more than 3000 childrens books published that year, roughly 50% featured main characters who were White. Only 10% featured Black characters, 7% featured Asian / Pacific Islander characters, and 5% featured Latinx characters. (27% of the books surveyed featured animal characters.) By far the least represented group in childrens literature were Native Americans, who appeared in fewer than 1% of the books surveyed. This course explores the ethics and impact of inclusive representation in childrens media. It focuses on the challenge of teaching young people under-represented histories, particularly when those histories engage with raw, difficult, and often still painful subjects. How can we tell historically accurate stories to children without whitewashing or sugarcoating the past? Why is the drive to make childrens media more inclusive critically important? A major component of this course involves experiential learning. Working together in small groups, and with guidance from experts in childrens publishing (editors, authors, illustrators, librarians), students will research, write, and publish a book for children on a topic related to Native American history. Readings will combine scholarship about childrens literature and publishing, the importance of historical representation and storytelling, and Native American history. Students will engage directly with the local community through focus groups, discussions with Native American knowledge keepers and cultural consultants, as well as visits to local libraries and the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art. This course is open to all and no prior experience is necessary, however students must be willing to work collaboratively, and will be required to attend one out-of-class field trip. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: collaborative group work, readings and discussions, field trips, artistic work, independent research, visual analysis, oral presentations, and writing/storytelling.",

These questions raise even more basic questions. What sorts of things are valuable for human beings? How does a just society distribute the goods that it produces? What role should citizens play in a democracy, and what sort of education do they need in order to play that role effectively? How does education differ from indoctrination?

    "description": "In this course, we will leave the classroom and get out on the land. The class begins in winter, a time when many people huddle indoors. We will instead go outside and read the winterland, beginning with a tracking workshop. Readings will include Robin Kimmerers influential essay, The Language of Animacy, which uses the lens of Indigenous languages to reconsider the boundaries of personhood. We will discuss how language shapes the ways in which we categorize other beings, such as animals and trees, as well as other humans. Our close reading of land and texts will enable us to see how our reading practices are shaped by language. Spring will take us to local waterways, including Amherst Colleges Wildlife Sanctuary and the Quabbin Reservoir, where we will read William Cronons classic essay, The Trouble with Wilderness in relation to these built environments. Lauret Savoys Trace will lead us to consider our embodied experiences and histories in relation to the places where we live. Throughout, we will grapple with critical questions. How are concepts like nature and culture intertwined with constructions of race and gender? How has the conservation of wilderness been entangled with colonial dispossession and removal? Even as we spend much of our class time on the ground, we will cultivate the craft of writing as a deliberative, interactive process, with frequent informal writing, collaborative workshops and creative nonfiction. Students will be asked to send a short writing sample and/or a statement about why they want to take the course. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Outdoor education, including close attention to landscape, moderate hiking, cold weather, snow, mud. Immersive learning. Emphasis on reading, written work, group work, field trips, visual analysis, kinesthetic learning, aural learning.",

How do different social groups imagine, identify, and experience environmental change? Why does this matter for our collective environmental futures? Integrating diverse perspectives into the historical narrative of human-environment interactions, we investigate various geological and cultural contexts, structures of inequality, and the changing relationship between nature and culture. Drawing together recent work in anthropology as well as science studies, political ecology, and critical geography, the course emphasizes how processes of power and expertise work in tandem to shape peoples claims to the environment. Ultimately, with an eye toward the slow violence of ecological catastrophe, we consider the theoretical and political implications of living within nonconsensual chemical, colonial, and capital entanglements.",

A provisional answer from the field of sound studies is: no, the falling tree produces vibration, but does not make a sound absent a listening, hearing human subject. Take another step, and we arrive at ethnomusicologist John Blackings time-honored (but not unproblematic) definition of music as humanly organized sound and soundly organized humanity. In this course, we linger at the intersections of sound and music, listening and hearing to learn about the human. What happens as we encounter music, sound, and voice as forms of vibration available to our senses rather than as texts and sonic objects? How are listening and hearing culturally specific practices shaped by particular histories, identities, technologies, hierarchies of the senses, capitalist desires, human ecologies, concepts of ability and disability, and the work of performers, scholars, and sound artists? In addressing these questions through listening exercises and readings in music, sound, media studies, and anthropology, and listening exercises, we will employ what Pauline Oliveros calls Deep Listening (an ethical practice of listening to other humans and non-humans and to music) as a research methodology. Ultimately, this course will attune us to the urgency of listening to the sounds of protest, hearing voices speaking and singing across differences of power and privilege, and attending to what the sounds of the Anthropocene signal.

    "description": "Sociology emerged as part of the intellectual response to the French and Industrial Revolutions. In various ways, the classic sociological thinkers sought to make sense of these changes and the kind of society that resulted from them. We shall begin by examining the social and intellectual context in which sociology developed and then turn to a close reading of the works of five important social thinkers: Marx, Tocqueville, Weber, Durkheim, and DuBois. We shall attempt to identify the theoretical perspective of each thinker by posing several basic questions: According to each social thinker, what is the general nature of society, the individual, and the relationship between the two? What holds societies together? What pulls them apart? How does social change occur? What are the distinguishing features of modern Western society in particular? What distinctive dilemmas do individuals face in modern society? What are the prospects for human freedom and happiness? Although the five thinkers differ strikingly from each other, we shall also determine the extent to which they share a common sociological consciousness.",

Global interest in British art and design endures, as seen in the phenomena of period dramas like Bridgerton and the spread of Arts & Crafts patterns for interior decor. But what were the historical contexts that gave rise to these styles, and how do we understand, or perhaps misunderstand, these histories in the present? The creation of the British Galleries at the Met (2020) and the reopening of the Yale Center of British Art (2025) provide exciting opportunities to reconsider popular movements and motifs. How were art and design, including architecture, domestic goods, and the fine arts, inflected by artists and consumers identities and beliefs? We will discuss how colonization and appropriation, cultural exchanges, political movements, religious conflicts, and technological revolutions impacted the look and feel of British life. This course will include the in-person study of objects in local collections and further afield. We will explore different kinds of art writing as we seek to analyze objects and trends of the past and their persistence in the present.

Beginning with the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947, the non-European territories, which once comprised the lucrative possessions of modern European empires, quickly became independent states charged with developing infrastructure, erecting national monuments, and handling the influx of laborers drawn to the metropolises formed as sleepy colonial towns grew into bustling postcolonial cities. This class will examine the buildings, urban spaces, rural landscapes, and national capitals that emerged in response to these political histories. We will approach a number of issues, such as the architecture of national independence monuments, the preservation of buildings linked to the colonial past, the growth of new urban centers in Africa and India after independence, architecture and regimes of postcolonial oppression, the built environments of tourism in the independent Caribbean, and artists responses to all of these events. Some of the places that we will address include: Johannesburg, South Africa; Chandigarh, India; Negril, Jamaica; Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo; and Lilongwe, Malawi. Our goal will be to determine what, if any, continuities linked the buildings, landscapes, and spaces of post-independence Africa, India, and the Caribbean in the twentieth century. Over the course of the semester, students will gain skills in analyzing buildings, town plans, and other visual materials. Also, this class will aid students in developing their writing skills, particularly, their ability to write about architecture and urban space.",

A literary, cinematic, architectural, photographic and visual art, Expressionism mined the tensions between alienation and empathy, matter and spirit, representation and abstraction, politics and community, the city and the natural world. Our investigations begin with early twentieth century artists like Edvard Munch, Wassily Kandinsky and E.L. Kirchner and the Dadaist works of Otto Dix and George Grosz, as well as photographers and artists associated with the New Objectivity such as August Sander and Kathe Kollwitz. We will also consider examples of early Expressionist film, and the phenomena of Expressionist architecture -- manifested in buildings, drawings, and imaginative environments. We will conclude with postwar artists such as Joseph Beuys, Asger Jorn and Eva Hesse; Abstract Expressionists like Jackson Pollock; and Neo-Expressionist artists such as Anselm Kiefer and Gerhard Richter. Our class will focus on original works of art in the Five College Museums, culminating in a student curated pop-up exhibition of newly acquired Expressionist drawings at the Smith College Museum of Art. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on historical and visual analysis, theoretical reading, research, presentation, and writing, including curatorial practice.

Then, we examine sustainable design in relation to issues such as inequality and marginality. As we do this, we locate sustainability within the larger environmental movement, studying in detail some of the main approaches and standards of sustainable design, the attempts to improve this practice over time, and the specific challenges confronting these attempts.

Along the way, we will study the political and economic impetus that drove governments, militaries, municipalities, and private entities to create renderings of the land on which we live. We will also investigate the technological history of map-making as we consider the extent to which innovations in modern science have influenced the production of maps. This course will challenge the presumption that maps are factual portrayals of physical space. It will also question how divergent forms of culturally based knowledge as well as economic constraints and corporate rivalries have historically influenced map-making and subsequently shaped our understanding of territories near and far. We will think through these issues while investigating a number of major topics in the history of modern cartography: map-making and indigenous expertise in the Americas prior to and during European intervention; colonial cartography in the Americas, Asia, and Africa; the explosion of the map-making industry in eighteenth and nineteenth-century England and France; the mapping of oceans and other remote landscapes during this time; the twentieth-century genre of pictorial maps in the United States; cartography and modern warfare; and artists responses to these histories. Through written assignments and a final creative project, students will build their writing and research skills while gaining knowledge of the methods that scholars employ when reading a wide variety of maps. Moreover, in approaching contemporary debates in the field of cartography, this course will introduce students to landscape studies.",

Through studio assignments, site visits, readings, and discussions, we will explore themes of representation, ownership, ecology, and environmental crises that reckon with loss but also generate sites of hope and imagination toward the future. How do we represent a shifting, fluid landscape? How do maps emerge as anchors of reference through which communities make sense of their transfigured environments, and where does the logic of the map break down? Supplementing our studio work we will consider a range of artists, landscape architects, and writers who consider these questions. Assignments will be rooted in drawing and may include collage, writing, performance, installation, media, and interdisciplinary approaches.

    "description": "This course will address a number of developments and transformations in contemporary urban architecture and performance from an international perspective. We will explore issues including, but not limited to, trauma, memory, absence, perception, corporeality, representation, and the senses in our examination of recent work in Germany and elsewhere, and read a number of texts from the fields of philosophy, critical theory, performance studies, and visual and architectural studies, in an attempt to understand how architecture is beginning to develop compositional systems in which to envision dynamic and responsive spaces in specific cultural contexts. We will focus our research on the work of a number of German and international architects, performance, and new media artists, including Jochen Gerz, Renata Stih and Frieder Schnock, Horst Hoheisel, Micha Ullman, Shimon Attie, Daniel Libeskind, Peter Eisenman, Rem Koolhaas, Greg Lynn, Mark Goulthorpe, Mariam Kamara, R & Sie(n), Axel Kilian, Paul Privitera, Diebedo Francis Kere, Hani Rashid and Lise-Anne Couture, Ini Archibong, Herzog and de Meuron, Archigram, David Adjaye, William Forsythe, Jan Fabre, Rachel Whiteread, Rebecca Horn, Mario Gooden, Sasha Waltz, Richard Siegal, Michael Schumacher, Mwanzaa Brown, Robert Wilson, the Blix Brothers of Berlin, Maya Lin, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Pina Bausch, Granular Synthesis, Sponge, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Miku Dixit, Toni Dove, Chris Parkinson and Tessa Kelly, and many others. Students will develop projects in various media (video, performance, text, design, online) and deliver a number of critical oral and written presentations on various aspects of the course material and their own projects. Emphasis on developing research, writing, and presentation skills is a core of this seminar. Conducted in English, with German majors required to do a substantial portion of the reading in German.

    "description": "Founded in 1526 by a Muslim prince from Central Asia, the Mughal dynasty dominated the political landscape of South Asia (including present-day India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh) until the middle of the nineteenth century. The influence of the Mughal Empire also extended well beyond South Asia, making it one of the most important players in the premodern global arena. This course will examine the great range of art and architecture produced for the Mughal emperors and members of their court, placing special emphasis on how these materials (and their makers) helped create a powerful, multifaceted image of empire. We will explore illustrated manuscripts and monumental architecture, including the justly famous Taj Mahal, but also expand our purview to consider less studied objects such as carved jade vessels, inscribed gems, inlaid metalwork, and textiles. We will pay particular attention to Mughal encounters with the arts of India's Hindu kings, the Safavid Empire, the Jesuit missionaries, the royal courts of Europe, and the British East India Company. We will also consider how race, gender, sexuality, and colonialism factored within these contexts. Films and field trips to local museum collections will supplement assigned readings and lectures. Participation in class discussion, a significant component of the course, is expected. No previous background is presumed, and all readings will be available in English. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close analysis of historical evidence, which may include written documents, images, and architecture from the historical period under study. Exploration of scholarly, methodological, and theoretical debates about historical topics. Extensive reading, varying forms of written work, and intensive in-class discussions.",

As it is possible to approach color from many different disciplines, we encourage any interested student to register. A core goal of the course is to encourage a holistic discussion of the topic. Students will be asked to write about their observations of color through art and will have the opportunity to make their own original pieces. In addition, class activities will include lectures, invited speakers, discussion, and a final project.

Weather is omnipresent, uncontrollable, and ever-changing, qualities that make it difficult to represent. Yet diverse observers have long attempted to picture weather, from painters creating aesthetic effects, to meteorologists seeking accurate forecasts, to activists pursuing political change. In this course, we will consider how and to what ends weather has been given visual form. We will look broadly across artistic and scientific media from the eighteenth century to the present, with particular focus on local artworks and archives including the records of Amherst's weather station, in continuous operation since 1835. In turn, we will examine the effects of weather on art, such as the decay of outdoor sculptures. Ultimately, we will interrogate the possibilities for representing weather in an era of anthropogenic climate change, asking: how do we picture weather of our own making?

    "description": "Eco is derived from the Latin oeco, house. That means that the word ecology was coined to discuss the study of our home and community. What does art, which is also about making place and participating in community, contribute to this field of knowledge? How can art challenge what we already know about our surroundings and the relationships that take place within them? What else can we perceive and communicate through artistic research and practice? How can we notice and creatively denounce neglect of our environment? Or devise new rituals and practices of care? In this studio art course, we will review a broad range of art forms including artworks from the environmental art and land art movements; collaborative and sustainable practices that include natural materials and processes; and artworks addressing social and political issues around ecology and the climate crisis. Students in this class will also develop their own artworks in a range of scales and mediums including but not limited to paper-making, installation, landscape interventions, sculptures, and socially-engaged projects. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Studio art projects, field work, visual analysis, readings, class discussions.",

The Transpacific intertwines two narratives: the Pacific as a space of expansionism and imperialism, and the Pacific as a zone of alternative alliances. Engagements across the Pacific have been formed by European, Japanese, and American imperialisms that continue to the present day, but migrations among Asia, Latin America, and North America have also offered other possibilities for postcolonial, decolonial, and deimperial imaginaries that articulated new identities, alignments, and revolutions. Topics include export objects, diasporic architecture, colonial modernisms, documentary photography, revolutionary printmaking, Cold War abstraction, postwar avant-gardes, and contemporary ecopoetics of the ocean.

What is the network of auctions, galleries, and fairs overseeing the buying and selling of works of art and how is value decided, constructed, and transformed in the process? How do we understand and calculate the value of art in both economic and symbolic terms? How do you buy and sell a work of performance art? What agency do artists possess in determining how their work operates in the market and how have artists played with the market since the 1960s? Finally, in what ways does the making, buying, and selling of works of art conform to and diverge from the operations of the economy at large? Using texts by Karl Marx, Thorstein Veblen, Eve Chiapello, and Jean-Joseph Goux, among others, as a theoretical foundation, we will explore the relationship between works of art and commodities and the ways in which artists both embrace and critique the commercial side of the art world. We will also study the recent attention paid to the dirty money funding arts institutions and trace a longer history of this phenomenon and its contestation by artists, activists, and artist-activists.",

    "description": "What does European art history look like when seen from models perspectives? Starting in the Renaissance, the ability to convincingly depict the human form became regarded as the height of artistic achievement, and life models became central to artistic learning and practice. Although models were fundamental to art making, their identities, stories, and artistry have often been omitted from the study of art history. More often than not, models were from marginalized groups, leading to their exploitation for arts sake. Furthermore, access to models remained largely forbidden for women artists. In this class, we will grapple with this troublesome history and interrogate the crucial contribution of the models labor to European art from the sixteenth century to the present day. We will study life drawings, depictions of modeling sessions, and resulting final works like history paintings and sculpture, alongside sources including memoirs and archival records, to develop a fuller understanding of the role of models. We will also consider topics like dissection and anatomical study, mannequins, and plaster casts. Our meetings will be divided between in-depth class discussion and activities such as life drawing, visiting collections, and speaking with contemporary art models to gain critical perspectives on the past and ethical practices in the present. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on readings, artistic work, independent research, oral presentations, visual analysis, artistic practice, field trips and activities.",

We will use what we learn from these examples to inspire our own solo material. We will also develop additional techniques (through improvisational trial and error) that enliven and engage our different voices, stories, imaginations and emotions. An emphasis will be placed on exploring and crafting dynamic relationships within and between different media and modes of expression in order to create confident and compelling solo presentations for live and virtual arenas. We will consider the solo as both a personal vehicle of expression and as a means of giving voice to experiences of others. In the process of making compositional choices, we will consider the personal and social implications of these choices. The semester will culminate in public performances of final solos.

    "description": "The Shahnameh (Book of Kings), completed by Abul Qasim Ferdowsi around 1010, is one of the world's greatest epics, and also one of the most enigmatic. The Shahnameh tells the history of pre-Islamic Iran from the beginnings of civilization until the Arab conquest in the seventh century A.D. Its tales of battles, romance, heroism, and betrayal have been appreciated as literature for centuries. At the same time, its been deployed for political and cultural ends. Many of the communities who have most enthusiastically embraced its stories and themes have been of non-Iranian origin. Indeed, Ferdowsis patron, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, was himself of Turkic background. Since the nineteenth century, it has been touted as the cultural cornerstone of an emphatically non-Muslim modern Iranian national identity, and yet the author and his patron were Muslim. Some have even interpreted the Shahnameh as encouraging conversion to Islam. This course will explore the Shahnameh as literature, history, and material culture including illustrated manuscripts, printed books, ceramics, metalwork, and posters from Ferdowsis tenth-century context to the contemporary moment. We will focus in particular on a heavily illustrated mid-nineteenth-century printed copy of the Shahnameh made in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, now in Amherst Colleges Archives and Special Collections, and consider how this work expressed a non-Islamic cultural foundation of modernity. We will follow this story to explore how the Shahnameh figures in debates over the pre-Islamic past today. All readings are available in English. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on close reading, written work, visual analysis, independent research, group work, field trips.",

Beginning with case studies from the 1950s and reaching the present day, this course will explore the variable durabilities, ephemeralities, and queer existences of works of art, ranging from sculptures to performances to NFTs.

    "description": "Essay filmmaking is a dynamic form with many commonly cited attributes the presence of an authorial voice, an emphasis on broad themes, an eclectic approach to genre, and the tendency to digress or draw unexpected connections. Yet, true to its nature, the precise definition of the essay film is in constant flux. It can be both personal and political, individual and collective, noble and mischievous. Essay filmmakers themselves are equally diverse, ranging from established film auteurs to Third Cinema activists and contemporary video artists. If we entertain the notion that the processes of cinema closely resemble the mechanics of human thought, then the essay film may be the medium's purest expression. To watch or make such a film, we must give ourselves over to a compulsive, restless energy that delights in chasing a subject down any number of rabbit holes and blind alleys, often stopping to admire the scenery on the way. As with thought, there is no end product, no clear boundaries, no goal but the activity itself. The term \"essay\" finds its origins in the French essayer, meaning to attempt or to try. In this advanced production workshop, we will read, screen and discuss examples of the essayistic mode in literature and cinema while making several such attempts of our own. Students will complete a series of writing assignments and video projects informed by class materials and group discussion. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on artistic practice, personal writing, group critique, critical readings and film screenings.",

We will compare and contrast the historical experiences of specific groups of the A/P/A community; namely, those of Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Southeast Asian (Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Hmong), Asian Indian, and Pacific Islander descent. The first half of the course examines the U.S. involvement in the quest for empire in Asia-Pacific, spanning the period from approximately 1850 to World War II, focusing on the experiences of the Chinese, Filipinos, and Pacific Islanders in the United States. The second half examines the experiences of the various A/P/A communities, and relates these with the continuing U.S. imperialist and neo-colonialist policies throughout the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close analysis of historical evidence (written documents, images, music, films, or statistics from the historical period under study). Exploration of scholarly, methodological, and theoretical debates about historical topics. Extensive reading, varying forms of written work, and intensive in-class discussions.

Along the way, this course will introduce students to key debates in the scholarly study of video games. For instance, some rhetoricians argue that role playing games are more immersive than traditional media because of their haptic and tactile elements, whereas others argue that they are procedural instruments whose rules actually stifle creativity and imagination. We will familiarize ourselves with such debates, while also paying attention to dynamics of class, gender, race, and sexuality. Apart from reading about games, this class will also ask students to play a variety of them (mobile, computer, and console) and write about them. The course will also ask students to consider television and filmic adaptations of games. Games to be covered in course materials include mainstream games such as: Baldurs Gate, World of Warcraft, Pokemon GO, The Last of Us, and Call of Duty; and classic and indie games such as Papers please, Pong, Tetris, and Gone Home.

    "description": "This course introduces students to foundational texts in Asian American and Pacific Islander studies. By emphasizing Asian American and Pacific Islander, this course foregrounds the and as a necessary tension between two groups that have been differently racialized. Some questions that will orient our engagement with these fields include: How does literature shape ideas about what it means to be Asian American or Pacific Islander? What is the role of discourse in (en)gendering ideas about East/West, Asia, the Pacific, and Otherness? And what methods do scholars of Asian American and Pacific critique draw on to analyze complex systems of race, empire, militarism, settler colonialism, and capitalism? Taking seriously the Black feminist literary critic Barbara Christians argument that literature for people of color has often constituted a form of theorizing, we will pair works of critical theory (by Lisa Lowe, Colleen Lye, Edward Said, Anne Anlin Cheng, Jodi Kim, J. Kehaulani Kauanui, Teresia Teaiwa, Epeli Hauofa, Haunani-Kay Trask, and more), with forms of literary theorizing in novels, poetry, performances, and essays by canonical and contemporary authors including Monique Truong, Jessica Hagedorn, Nora Okja Keller, Ocean Vuong, Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Albert Wendt, Craig Santos Perez, Julian Aguon, and more. At the end of the course, students will not only have a sense of how Asian American and Pacific studies complicate concepts of identity, belonging, and political power; they will also have an understanding of how those fields of study can help us imagine otherwise, as the critic Kandice Chuh puts it, moving us from the analysis of structures of power to creating possibilities for their transformation and reimagining. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: weekly reading journal entries, close reading, in-class small group and class discussions, essay writing, and oral presentations.

This class will study Palestinian literatures potential to intervene in imperial histories that have been built on decades of ethnic cleansing and archival destruction. First, well study twentieth-century Palestinian history linearly, examining narrative literature on Ottoman Palestine, the British Mandate, the 1948 Nakba, the 1967 Naksa, the Lebanese Civil War, and the Intifadas. We will then turn to speculative works that cut across time, imagining alternate futures and potentializing what Ariella Azoulay calls the imperial timeline of history. This class will consider Palestinian literature across national and linguistic borders, considering literatures relationship to statist power and its capacity to collaborate with, and critique, anti-imperial resistance. Taking seriously the idea of Palestine as a metaphor for liberation everywhere, we will read Palestinians as a society capable of narrating their own history, and as a community building solidarity with other liberation struggles. Readings may include Ghassan Kanafani, Sahar Khalifeh, Adania Shibli, Emile Habiby, Mourid Barghouti, Maya Abu Al-Hayyat, and Isabella Hammad, alongside historical framing from Nur Masalha, Nadia Abu El-Haj, Sherene Seikaly, Rashid Khalidi, and Gil Hochberg.

Students will acquire vocabulary, grammatical knowledge, and language skills necessary for everyday interactions as well as skills that will allow them to communicate with a limited working proficiency in a variety of situations, read and write about a variety of factual material and familiar topics in non-technical prose. By the end of this course, students will be able to: Understand information conveyed in simple, predictable, loosely connected texts. Readers in this level rely heavily on contextual clues. They can most easily understand information if the format of the text is familiar, such as in a weather report or a social announcement. Students will be able to understand texts that convey basic information such as that found in announcements, notices, and online bulletin boards and forums. Reading texts are non-complex and have a predictable pattern of presentation. The discourse is minimally connected and primarily organized in individual sentences and strings of sentences containing predominantly high-frequency vocabulary. Understand information conveyed in simple, sentence-length speech on familiar or everyday topics. They are generally able to comprehend one utterance at a time while engaged in face-to-face conversations or in routine listening tasks such as understanding highly contextualized messages, straightforward announcements, or simple instructions and directions. Successfully handle a limited number of uncomplicated communicative tasks by creating with the language in straightforward social situations. Conversation is restricted to some of the concrete exchanges and predictable topics necessary for survival in the target-language culture. These topics relate to basic personal information; for example, self and family, some daily activities and personal preferences, and some immediate needs, such as ordering food and making simple purchases. Meet some practical writing needs. They can create statements and formulate questions based on familiar material. Most sentences are re-combinations of learned vocabulary and structures. These are short and simple conversational-style sentences with basic word order. They are written in present or past time. Topics are tied to highly predictable content areas and personal information. In this course students will complete textbook exercises, write short essays, do oral and video presentations and participate in role-plays, discussions, and conversations in addition to extra-curricular activities and a final project.",

You will have broad enough vocabulary that will enable you to read within a normal range of speed with almost complete comprehension a variety of authentic prose material and be able to write about similar topics. Also by the end of this course, you should have a wide range of communicative language ability including grammatical knowledge, discourse knowledge and sociolinguistic knowledge of the Arabic language. You should expect text assignments as well as work with DVDs, audio and video materials and websites. Exercises and activities include essay writing, social interactions, role plays and in-class conversations, oral and video presentations that cover the interplay of language and culture, extra-curricular activities and a final project. Students are expected to make four presentations using technology like Google Slides, write four essays in the form of a story, argument, and analysis, and complete a final project in the form of a collage and present it in class, which will be a summary of the four chapters they learned. For this, students can use pictures and other creative tools.",

Yet, histories of the global conflict still tend to focus disproportionately on the European theater. Countering that tendency, this course surveys the Asian theater, asking and answering a number of questions: How did imperialism and the rise of nationalist movements precipitate total war in Asia? What was the character of the warfare and how did it transform politics and societies in Asia? How did the war alter the geopolitical configuration of Asia and give rise to the Cold War? What are the continuing legacies of the war in the region today? While we will use Japan as a fulcrum to engage these questions, the course will attend to the regional dynamics of World War II in Asia. This is a 100-level survey that presumes no prior familiarity with Asia or the Second World War. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close analysis of historical evidence, which may include written documents, images, music, films, or statistics from the historical period under study.

China also went through a difficult transformation from a traditional society into a modern industrial nation.

    "description": "The transformation of the Japanese archipelago from a relatively secluded agrarian polity in the early-nineteenth century into the worlds second largest economic power by the end of the twentieth century is one of the most dramatic stories of modern history. This course introduces the history of this transformation through two revolutions: the formation of an imperialist nation-state and the post-World War II creation of a pacifist democracy. Situating these revolutions within regional and global contexts, we will pay close attention to the political debates and social conflicts that accompanied Japans drastic transformations. We will begin with the collapse of the Tokugawa shogunate, follow the rise of the modern Japanese nation-state through colonial expansion and total war, and conclude with postwar economic recovery, democratization, and the socio-political challenges facing the Japanese nation-state in the twenty-first century. Our goal along the way will be to explore in the specific context of Japanese history themes relevant to the history of global modernities: the collapse of a traditional regime, the creation of a nation-state, imperialism, industrialization, feminist and socialist critiques, total war, democratization, high economic growth and mass consumerism, including so-called otaku culture. Classes will entail lectures combined with close readings and discussions that engage primary texts, interpretive essays, and film.

    "description": "The Shahnameh (Book of Kings), completed by Abul Qasim Ferdowsi around 1010, is one of the world's greatest epics, and also one of the most enigmatic. The Shahnameh tells the history of pre-Islamic Iran from the beginnings of civilization until the Arab conquest in the seventh century A.D. Its tales of battles, romance, heroism, and betrayal have been appreciated as literature for centuries. At the same time, its been deployed for political and cultural ends. Many of the communities who have most enthusiastically embraced its stories and themes have been of non-Iranian origin. Indeed, Ferdowsis patron, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, was himself of Turkic background. Since the nineteenth century, it has been touted as the cultural cornerstone of an emphatically non-Muslim modern Iranian national identity, and yet the author and his patron were Muslim. Some have even interpreted the Shahnameh as encouraging conversion to Islam. This course will explore the Shahnameh as literature, history, and material cultureincluding illustrated manuscripts, printed books, ceramics, metalwork, and posters from Ferdowsis tenth-century context to the contemporary moment. We will focus in particular on a heavily illustrated mid-nineteenth-century printed copy of the Shahnameh made in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, now in Amherst Colleges Archives and Special Collections, and consider how this work expressed a non-Islamic cultural foundation of modernity. We will follow this story to explore how the Shahnameh figures in debates over the pre-Islamic past today. No previous background is presumed, and all readings are available in English. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on close reading, written work, visual analysis, independent research, group work, field trips.",

Threading through the entire course is a provocative dialogue between, on the one hand, modern events and intellectual currents such as scientific rationalism, secularization, imperialism, nationalism, feminism, and environmentalism, and on the other hand, seminal Buddhist teachings that stand profoundly persuasive across time and space. We unpack this dialogue through stories, which are drawn from China, Japan, Taiwan, Tibet, Vietnam, and from Europe and America. The seminar highlights literature as a vehicle for spiritual reflection especially in a global and postsecular world. All readings are in English. Requirements include weekly reflection papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper. Two class meetings per week. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: an emphasis on written work, readings, independent research, oral presentations, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, visual analysis.",

    "description": "Japanese uses three different writing systems, one of which is called Kanji, with characters that were borrowed from China. A linguist, R.A. Miller (1986) in his book Nihongo (Japanese), writes: The Japanese writing system is, without question, the most complicated and involved system of script employed today by any nation on earth; it is also one of the most complex orthographies ever employed by any culture anywhere at any time in human history. The difficulty lies not merely in the number of characters that students must learn (roughly a couple of thousand), but also in the unpredictable nature of the ways these characters are used in Japanese. It is not possible in regular Japanese language courses to spend very much time on the writing system because the students must learn other aspects of the language in a limited number of class hours. This writing system is, however, not impossible to learn. In this half course, the students will learn the Japanese writing system historically and metacognitively, in group as well as individual sessions, and aim to overcome preconceived notions of difficulty related to the learning of Kanji. Each student in this course is expected to master roughly 500 Kanji that are used in different contexts. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on writing Japanese characters by hand; understanding principles of characters; increasing the number of mastered characters; independent work; autonomous practice; in-class quizzes or tests.",

Scientists often turn to the study of genes and mutations when trying to decipher the molecular mechanisms that underlie such diverse processes as the making of an embryo, the response of cells to their environment, or the defect in a heritable disease. All of the reading in the course will be from the primary literature, where students will engage with data from genetic experiments that shed light on the workings of a signal transduction pathway. Students will learn from these examples how to use genetic analysis to formulate models that explain the molecular function of a gene product. In the laboratory students will apply these approaches to their own semester-long project, taking responsibility for experimental design and execution as well as data interpretation and analysis. Three hours of lecture and four hours of laboratory per week; the laboratory projects will require time outside of class hours.

To explore this question, the lecture portion of the course will address the foundational neuroendocrinological pathways such as the sex steroids, nonapeptides, and corticosteroids. We will read and discuss primary literature articles on how these pathways shape social behavior across domains including mate choice, reproduction, parenting, aggression, and stress. Importantly, these papers will highlight a variety of animal models in order to explore the immense diversity of mating systems, sexual determination systems, and social community and hierarchy structures seen across the animal kingdom. The laboratory component of the course will apply both the behavioral and the neuromolecular concepts discussed in the lecture portion of the class through hands-on experiments in which students observe animal behavior and then process brain tissue to label and image proteins of interest. At the end of the semester, students will present their lab findings in a class symposium. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week plus one scheduled optional hour of laboratory preparation assistance per week. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will first be given to biology and neuroscience seniors who require the course to graduate and then to junior biology and neuroscience and then by class year or instructor consent. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Learning in BIOL-313 is facilitated by attendance and participation in three lectures per week and one laboratory per week, as well as peer discussion that is emphasized in both the laboratory component and the paper discussions in lecture. Skills being emphasized include applying the scientific method, analytical thinking, experimental design, ethical consideration, scientific communication, reading and synthesis, reflection, reducing anthropomorphism, and creativity. Assessments include individual short quizzes, written literature reflections, laboratory primers, participation points in both lecture and lab, and group presentations on laboratory research results.",

We will explore the chemical and structural properties of biological molecules and learn the logic used by the cell to build complex structures from a few basic raw materials. Some of these complex structures have evolved to catalyze chemical reactions with an enormous degree of selectivity and specificity, and we seek to discover these enzymatic strategies. We will consider the detailed balance sheet that shows how living things harvest energy from their environment to fuel metabolic processes and to reproduce and grow. Examples of the exquisite control that permits a cell to be responsive and adapt its responses based on input from the environment will be considered. We will also consider some of the means by which cells respond to change and to stress. A student may not receive credit for both CHEM/BIOL 330 and BCBP/BIOL/CHEM 331.

    "description": "This interdisciplinary introduction to Black Studies combines the teaching of foundational texts in the field with instruction in reading and writing. The first half of the course employs How to Read a Book by Mortimer Adler and Charles Van Doren as a guide to the careful reading of books focusing on the slave trade and its effects in Africa, the Caribbean, and the United States. Important readings in this part of the course include Black Odyssey by Nathan Huggins, Racism: A Short History by George Frederickson, and The Black Jacobins by C. L. R. James. The second half of the course addresses important themes from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Beginning with The Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois, it proceeds through a range of seminal texts, including The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon and The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin. This part of the course utilizes Revising Prose by Richard Lanham to extend the lesson in reading from the first half of the semester into an exploration of precision and style in writing. Computer exercises based on Revising Prose and three short essaysone on a single book, another comparing two books, and the last on a major theme in the courseprovide the main opportunity to apply and reinforce skills in reading and writing learned throughout the semester. After taking this course, students at all levels of preparation should emerge not only with a good foundation for advancement in Black Studies but also with a useful set of guidelines for further achievement in the humanities and the social sciences. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: written work, independent research and oral presentations.",

In what ways has popular culture influenced our understanding of race, and how do creatives today resist, reject, and reimagine racial and ethnic difference on social media? How do gender, sexuality, and other categories of difference intersect with race and ethnicity, and can these intersections give us a better understanding of American culture? In this course, we will examine contemporary racial discourse in the United States, surveying its use as a contested fact of social life by authors, artists, theorists, and activists in the twentieth and twenty-first century. By studying a range of creative and critical texts, including literature, poetry, music, art, film, comedy, cultural criticism, and social media, the course will prepare students to read racial discourse critically across genres and disciplines while also introducing them to the rigors of academic reading and writing.

Art, trade, small-scale manufacturing, medical knowledge, religion, state systems, history, and legend all flourished before the formal political take-over of the continent by European powers in the late nineteenth century. We will explore this varied history of states and cultures in the African past. The course will focus primarily on the period between 1400 and 1885 by discussing four topics in depth: labor systems within African societies and the impact of both the trans-Atlantic and East African trades in enslaved people; the impacts of religion and political power on the rise and fall of the central African kingdom of Kongo; the genesis of the Zulu state in southern Africa and historical debates about the regional impact of the Zulu states expansion; and the changing roles of women as economic, political, and social actors. We will discuss differences between oral and written narratives to understand how Africans actively interpreted their histories and how later historians have re-interpreted, re-written, and occasionally silenced these earlier narratives. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: By the end of the semester, students will have: critically analyzed a range of primary and secondary sources to investigate the history of Africa before 1885 engaged in both open and structured discussions with their classmates developed the skills to write persuasively about specific topics and provide evidence to support their arguments in written assignments analyzed the historical construction of several state systems and social differences in Africa identified how social categories, including ethnicity, religious beliefs, and gender, changed over time and explained how these categories informed peoples experiences in the precolonial context.",

In a period featuring culture wars, deindustrialization in urban areas, the arrival of crack cocaine, deep cuts to public school funding, and the invasion of HIV/AIDS, the bourgeoning genre of hip hop reflected the complexities of survival for many Black youth in marginalized American neighborhoods. As the new artform became a business, America witnessed the realization of a conservative ascendancy that carried Ronald Reagan to the presidency, which transformed political discourse for the subsequent decades.

    "description": "The transition from white-minority rule in South Africa in 1994 ushered in a new era of independence and democracy in a troubled country whose name had become synonymous with apartheid. Yet that transition has not lived up to the high expectations of South Africans as many of the ruling structures built by the colonial and then apartheid regimes have endured, and economic and social inequality has increased in the nearly thirty years since Nelson Mandela was first elected President. Questions about whether South Africans can move beyond the legacy of the past haunt the current population. New interpretations of South African history have emerged as new generations of historians write the past. This course will explore established and emerging themes in the history of this fascinating country. We will cover a broad period from just before the beginning of white settlement in the mid-1600s to the present. The focus will be on understanding how South African populations have confronted and engaged with colonial rule, profound cultural changes, and the development of an oppressively unequal economic and political system. What are the roots of the current situation, and how do they shape and constrain future possibilities? How do people in contemporary South Africa confront the ideas that have shaped their understanding of their own country as they reconstruct their history? Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Over the course of the semester, we will: Analyze the historical construction of social difference in South Africa from the early 1600s to the present, including the precolonial, colonial, apartheid, and independent (post-1994) eras. Identify how social categories, including class, race, and gender, changed over time and explain how these categories informed the experiences of people living in southern Africa. Identify different forms of discrimination and assess how structural racism, sexism and classism have evolved and contributed to the development of political, social, and economic inequality. By the end of the semester, students will have: critically analyzed a range of primary and secondary sources; engaged in both open and structured discussions with their classmates; written two short papers and eight Moodle posts in response to assigned readings; and written one 10-page research paper on an individually chosen topic relating to southern Africa.",

Born in poverty-stricken Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance, Baldwin went on to become one of the twentieth centuries most influential essayists, novelists, orators, and political commentators---particularly around issues related to American race relations. Unapologetically black, queer, and radicalBaldwins writings have become a source of resurgent public interest, particularly in the wake of todays turbulent U.S. political climate. In this course we will study key moments in Baldwins oeuvre and situate the authors work in a variety of relevant historical contexts. We will pay particular attention to reoccurring themes that sit at the center of Baldwins political philosophy including: the power of love as an animating force for social transformation; the resilient nature of black resistance; the role and responsibility of artists- as-troublemakers; the limitations of white ally-ship, the dangers (and creative possibilities) of organized religion; and the ongoing problem of global white supremacy. In addition, we will place Baldwins writings in conversation with the voices of some of his contemporaries and literary progeny. One primary concern will be how to place Baldwins writings in conversation with current debates about race, gender, sexuality, and politics in contemporary America. Why does Baldwins work seem to resonate so forcefully with the social justice concerns of today and to what ends?

Francophone African Cinema offers a rich tapestry of themes addressing different periods of African history, its often-fraught relationship with France, as well as its evolving connection to culture, both on the continent and in the diaspora. In addition to film screenings, we will look at texts on African history and film theory. We will engage with theory from the perspective of African directors who have broken cinematic and aesthetic codes as well as cultural norms, giving voice to those who are often silenced. Some of the themes examined for the course are identity, tradition and modernity, colonialism, post-colonial realities, spirituality, and womens struggles and triumphs. Films may include classics such as Black Girl by Ousmane Sembene and Touki Bouki by Djibril Diop Mambety to more contemporary films such as Atlantics by Mati Diop and Felicite by Alain Gomis. There will also be mandatory screening times of films outside of class, approximately three hours per week. This course will be taught in English.

Beginning in the mid-twentieth century with Ralph Ellison's 1952 magnum opus Invisible Man, we will explore some of the major issues that have shaped the production of late African American literature, including the rise of various critical discourses (postmodernism, feminist theory, queer theory, black internationalism) as well as the influence of numerous twentieth and twenty-first century U.S. social movements (such as the civil rights, black power, women's rights, and black lives matter movements). Special attention will be paid to various new directions in the field of African American literature over the course of the past thirty years. We will likely engage with works of Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, Octavia Butler, Jesmyn Ward, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Ross Gay, Clint Smith, Roxanne Gay, and Alexis Pauline Gumbs, among others.

Du Bois's later two major works, Black Reconstruction in America and Dusk of Dawn. In doing so, we also engage some of the major secondary interpretive sources assessing his ideas. These sources (and Du Bois's) will force us to engage philosophy, history, sociology, and other fields and areas/themes of study including theories of political economy, histories of slavery and capitalism, twentieth century labor history, anti-colonial thought, and mid-twentieth century Black political thought. Thematically, we focus on any number of ideas: the politics of leadership and representation, the meaning and character of Black identity and development, the politics of resistance to Jim Crow, the relationship between politics and autobiography, the politics of colonialism and anti-colonialism, racial capitalism, and citizenship. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: There is an emphasis in the class on written work.

    "description": "Living organisms require resources to fuel the processes necessary for staying alive. We require a certain number of calories to fuel metabolic processes and to provide building blocks to replace old cells and build new ones. Our food should provide a balance of proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals that we need to consume regularly for a healthy existence. Yet humans have developed another relationship with food that can be either enriching or pathological. Sharing meals with others, developing the skills to enjoy the sensory pleasures of food, learning about other cultures through their gastronomic habits, and eating moderately while consciously are all examples of a deeper productive relationship with food. On the darker side, food can be a palliative to relieve our stress or satiate our addictions to sugar, fats, or salt. Modern humans can be so far removed from our food sources that we lose the connection between animal and meat and do not know if the food on our plates contains added hormones, pesticides, or genetically modified products. This course will examine our core requirements for food as we eat to live, and some of the cultural, social, historical, and culinary dimensions as we live to eat. Readings will include On Food and Cooking , by Harold McGee, Taste: Surprising Stories and Science About Why Food Tastes Good, by Barb Stuckey, and selections from Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking by Nathan Myhrvold, Chris Young and Maxime Billet. The three sections will meet together for 80-minute lecture/demos twice a week, and each section will meet separately for a culinary lab once a week for 180 minutes. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Students in this class will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning and assessment: group work, analytical writing, laboratory work as it pertains to food, collaborative projects, and a final class project.",

Specifically, we will be exploring the issues that control whether a specific reaction can occur (i.e., if it is even possible) and how fast a feasible reaction will occur. Closely connected to the first concern is the position of chemical equilibrium, which defines the direction in which a reaction will proceed and the extent to which it will occur. In spite of its universality in describing systems at equilibrium and whether interconversions are possible, thermodynamics makes no statement about the rate at which equilibrium is approached. We will use the language of thermodynamics to investigate chemical kinetics, the study of factors that determine reactions rates.

We will survey the interdisciplinary literature on the ways in which identitye.g., gender, class, race, sexuality, disabilityand context shape STEM persistence and belonging. In parallel, students will design projects that apply the findings of our research to develop resources and engage the STEM community, whether at the college, local, or national level. Coursework includes at least six hours a week for reading, reflective writing and project work. Expected class participation will require a commitment to building community across differences, active engagement in critical discussions that challenge assumptions and confront biases, and sharing in-progress project work in a public campus salon. For this iteration, the class will have a creative writing focus, in which students will explore their personal relationship to STEM and its history, and write works that connect the scientific world to a broader social context. Students taking this class for English credit will participate in craft-focused writing workshops with their peers. Expect scholarly work from the authors: Anthony Tony Jack, Bettina L. Love, Jasbir K Puar, Robin Wall Kimmerer, Leah Schmalzbauer, Dionne Brand, Olufemi O. Taiwo, Katherine McKittrick, & Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on critical reading, active engagement in discussion, including some facilitation, written reflections, and contribution to a final written or digital group project drawing from course materials, discussions, and independent research, which will be used as the basis for an oral presentation in a community salon.",

We will explore the chemical and structural properties of biological molecules and learn the logic used by the cell to build complex structures from a few basic raw materials. Some of these complex structures have evolved to catalyze chemical reactions with an enormous degree of selectivity and specificity, and we seek to discover these enzymatic strategies. We will consider the detailed balance sheet that shows how living things harvest energy from their environment to fuel metabolic processes and to reproduce and grow. Examples of the exquisite control that permits a cell to be responsive and adapt its responses based on input from the environment will be considered. We will also consider some of the means by which cells respond to change and to stress. A student may not receive credit for both CHEM/BIOL 330 and BCBP/BIOL/CHEM 331. Note: BCBP/BIOL/CHEM 331 is a requirement for the biochemistry track of the BCBP major, so prospective BCBP majors should not enroll in CHEM/BIOL 330 if they are considering the biochemistry track of the major. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on keeping up with content through textbook reading, active engagement during lecture and discussion meetings, exams, collaborative group work, and independent research in the literature culminating with the design and oral presentation of a poster.",

    "description": "Since its invention in Athens, tragic drama has focused upward on the great or mighty as they fall but also outward on the disempowered as they are for once given public voice: women, slaves, and barbarians. The cosmic forces of fate and the gods play out along social fault lines with conflicting viewpoints. We look to a hero, but, changing his mask, a Greek actor could go from god to wife to peasant. This multiplicity complicates itself in modern stagings and films as they cast actors with specific gender and racial identities. Female actors now have indisputable claim on the once-male roles of Antigone, Cassandra, Medea, and Electra, as they do on Shakespeares Cleopatra. The dialects of tragic performance are multiple: translationese, Shakespeare, and Spanglish. In this course we start with the formation of Hellenic identity and notions of heroism in Homer's Iliad and then look at the performance of plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Shakespeare in their historical context, as well as at adaptations in film and dance. We also consider remakings of the myths within modern realities, including Antigone in Ferguson; Rita Doves The Darker Face of the Earth (Oedipus); and Luis Alfaros Mojada (Medea), Electricidad (Electra), and Oedipus El Rey. For the bodies of comedy, we'll look at Spike Lees recasting of Aristophanes Lysistrata in Chi Raq. The course aims to give students independent command of influential plays, as well as insight into the aesthetics and politics of putting contemporary bodies into classic roles. We consider and apply core concepts relating to the representation of gender, race, and sexuality. The requirements are regular attendance and participation, brief before-class responses, and four essays.",

    "description": "We read in English the major authors from Homer in the eighth century BCE to Plato in the fourth century in order to trace the emergence of epic, lyric poetry, tragedy, comedy, history, and philosophy. How did the Greek enlightenment, and through it Western culture, emerge from a few generations of people moving around a rocky archipelago? How did folklore and myth develop into various forms of rationality: science, history, and philosophy? What are the implications of male control over public and private life and the written record? What can be inferred about ancient women if they cannot speak for themselves in the texts? How does slavery work in a culture when it is based on capture rather than racial difference? What do we hear when people in bondage are given voice in epic and drama? Other authors include Sappho, Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Thucydides.

    "description": "What makes a text a classic? Why do certain texts leave a mark, being reread and adapted over and over, but others not so much? This course is an atypical introduction to Roman literary history that pairs better- and lesser-known representatives of Romes major literary genres, with an eye to processes of reception and canon formation. In other words: an opportunity to (re)discover famous masterpieces as well as forgotten misfits of Roman literature. Students will also consider modern reinterpretations of some of these texts and try their hand at updating them for a contemporary audience. Topics of discussion will include the role of chance in transmission; translation in and of Roman literature; the connection of literature to empire; and the gendered and ethnic identities of authors. Authors may include Virgil and Silius Italicus (epic), Virgil and Calpurnius Siculus (pastoral), Lucretius and Manilius (didactic), Livy and the Historia Augusta (historiography), Vitruvius and Frontinus (technical literature), Catullus and Sulpicia (lyric), Juvenal and the Other Sulpicia (satire).

Even if much of the science has long been superseded, they continue to inform modern conceptions of health and the role of the medical practitioner. This course considers the presence of medicine and healing in the ancient world historically, moving from the evidence of early Greek poetry and philosophy, to the case histories, anatomical texts, and defenses of medicine in the Hippocratic Corpus, through to the writings of core Roman authors. On the way, we will have the opportunity to study how medical theories interacted with early scientific doctrines, how medical knowledge was reflected in ancient historical and dramatic texts, how pain and fear of death could be offset by philosophical techniques, and how doctors defined themselves in opposition to the priests and magicians with whom they were at times in competition.

    "description": "A man named Socrates lived in Athens, Greece, during the 5th century BCE. He was tried on grounds of impiety and corruption of the young, found guilty by a jury of approximately 500 of his fellow Athenians, and executed. During his life, Socrates was also engaged in a practice that was later dubbed philosophy. His importance in determining the scope and methods of the discipline is indicated by the fact that Greek philosophers who preceded him are typically referred to as Presocratic. But, as a philosopher, it is not entirely clear what Socrates believed. He never wrote down any of his views. In fact, Socrates is famous for denying that he had any wisdom of any significance. And yet, despite this apparent humility, later philosophers (Plato and Aristotle) and a contemporary playwright (Aristophanes) and historian (Xenophon) represent him as holding very definite views, supported by arguments, about how to live our best lives. Unfortunately, their reports are not consistent. In this course, we will be concerned to answer two questions: (1) What sort of evidence is relevant to determining the views of a philosopher who lived over two millennia ago? (2) What should we make of the views and arguments of this philosopher? In addition to the writing in translation that we can access from Amherst, MA, we will have the opportunity to learn more about Socrates by traveling to Athens, Greece over spring break to retrace Socrates own footsteps, learn from local Athenian historians, and explore carefully curated museum exhibits on Ancient Greek culture and society.

Every day, people use their time, talent and energy to produce, sell, buy and consume a bewildering variety of goods and services.  How are all these activities organized and connected?  How do societies decide what gets produced now, and how much to invest for the future?  Why do some people, and some groups, earn more than others, and how can the economy be made more equitable?  Why are some countries so much richer than others, and what might poor countries do to catch up?  What effect does international trade have on workers, consumers, and firms, both in the U.S. and overseas?  What can be done to mitigate the harmful effects of economic activity on the natural environment?  What role does government play in organizing economic activity?  Economics is the study of these and many other related questions.  We study both microeconomics, which looks at the role of consumers, markets, firms, and governments in determining how our society allocates its scarce resources; and macroeconomics, which addresses the economy as a whole, especially issues related to output, unemployment, productivity, and inflation. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Quantitative reasoning; modes of learning and assessment include readings, lectures, problem sets, in-class quizzes, exams, short paper, graphical analysis, group discussion.",

Every day, people use their time, talent and energy to produce, sell, buy and consume a bewildering variety of goods and services. How are all these activities organized and connected? How do societies decide what gets produced now, and how much to invest for the future? Why do some people, and some groups, earn more than others, and how can the economy be made more equitable? Why are some countries so much richer than others, and what might poor countries do to catch up? What effect does international trade have on workers, consumers, and firms, both in the U.S. and overseas? What can be done to mitigate the harmful effects of economic activity on the natural environment? What role does government play in organizing economic activity? Economics is the study of these and many other related questions. We study both microeconomics, which looks at the role of consumers, markets, firms, and governments in determining how our society allocates its scarce resources; and macroeconomics, which addresses the economy as a whole, especially issues related to output, unemployment, productivity, and inflation. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Quantitative reasoning; Modes of learning and assessment include readings, lectures, problem sets, in-class quizzes, exams, short paper, graphical analysis, group discussion.",

Behavioral economics studies how individuals actually make decisions, which may deviate from the way \"rational actors\" are modeled in terms of making decisions in classical economics. Motivated by non-fiction readings and academic articles, we will use behavioral economic frameworks to characterize this actual decision-making and to explore its consequences for markets and for policy. Topics covered include prospect theory, frameworks for intertemporal choice, the importance of framing and defaults, subjective well-being, and \"nudges.\" The class will be selected to achieve a group with diverse academic backgrounds and interests.

This course begins by examining the history of inequality in the U.S. since the start of the twentieth century. It then uses cutting-edge and detailed national data to document and explore the current state of inequality and intergenerational mobility in the U.S. We consider inequality by various metrics, such as race, gender, and geography, and in various outcomes, such as income, wealth, health, educational attainment, and incarceration. The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued. Finally, special attention is paid throughout the course to causal inference, and to students honing their skills at understanding the intuition behind commonly used research methods to estimate causal effects.

We will begin by exploring empirical data on international trade, addressing questions such as: How has trade evolved over time? Which countries exhibit trade deficits or surpluses? And which country pairs trade more than others? Moving forward, we will use classic models of international trade to discuss the determinants of trade patterns. Key questions we will address include: Why and how much do nations trade? What factors determine the composition of exported goods of a given country? Subsequently, we will analyze the impact of international trade, particularly its effects on welfare, wages, employment, and inequality. We will examine who may benefit and who may lose as a result of opening to trade. In the final section, we will discuss the implications of various trade policies, including tariffs, quotas, export subsidies, and trade agreements. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the application of theoretical frameworks to explain trade patterns observed in data and to analyze the impact of trade openness and policies.

    "description": "Education is one of the most promising ways to fight inequality, yet inequality in educational attainment is rising in the United States. This course focuses on understanding inequality in education in the U.S., and whether and how education reform can reduce it. The course begins with a brief overview of the historical and current relationship between educational attainment and inequality in the U.S. We then study the empirical economics literature examining whether prominent education policies and reforms reduce inequality in educational attainment. We examine topics in: 1) early childhood education, such as Head Start and universal preschool; 2) K-12 education, such as school finance reform, desegregation, and student-teacher race match; and 3) postsecondary education, such as affirmative action in college admissions, simplifying the college and financial aid application process, and financial aid during college. Throughout the semester, students learn commonly used empirical microeconometric research methods to identify causal impacts, and then employ these tools in their own empirical research paper. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Reading and engaging with academic research, writing analytical and theoretical economic papers, group work, quantitative and analytical reasoning, oral presentations.",

Geospatial analysis has been applied in economic research to examine an array of factors that shape economic development including roads, internet access, trade links, institutions, slavery, climate change, and inequality. We will carefully read a selection of journal articles that employ geospatial analysis, paying close attention both to the important economic insights as well as the econometric and geospatial methodologies employed in the articles. The course will begin with an introduction of the main types of datasets, tools and techniques employed in geospatial analysis using R programming language. In addition to carefully studying and discussing selected research papers that apply geospatial analysis, students will also replicate some of the analyses presented in these papers. Overall, the course aims to familiarize students with the application of geospatial analysis in cutting-edge economic research and enable them to develop an original research project that makes use of the tools and techniques explored in the course. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on written work, readings, oral presentations, independent research, in-class quizzes or exams, quantitative work, visual analysis.",

    "description": "For most of human history, all over the planet, people were sitting within a rather stable, Malthusian equilibrium, with very similar imputed levels of per capita income. This radically changed, for some, at the end of the eighteenth century. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to the economic development of the contemporary world and an opportunity to support research on a specific topic within economic history. We will first examine the long swing of the Malthusian equilibrium in pre-industrial economies, focusing on hunter gatherer and agrarian economies. Next, we will turn to examine the breakdown of the Malthusian equilibrium (occurring only in some parts of the world), and the long transition to rapid growth after the sixteenth century. Because we know that only certain regions of the world participated in this unprecedented growth, we will then examine the consequences of this great uneven shift, often referred to as the Great Divergence. The course requires both Macroeconomic and Microeconomic theory, as we will be examining the behavior and the consequences at both the individual, as well as the economy-wide, level. It is a seminar, so that students can engage in extended discussions of the material and pursue their own related research topic. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An understanding of the material in the prerequisites above.

As part of the work, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. This course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, it does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres including essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings in ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. The writing assignments cross many genres as well.

We will also consider ethnographic studies that explore how workers experience their lives inside organizations and how workplaces transform in response to changing legal regulations. These theoretical and empirical explorations will provide a foundation for reflections about how work structures opportunities in democratic societies and how re-imagining work might unleash human potential. The course will ground these questions about the role of work in the context of American politics and society. At the broadest level we will ask: Do citizens in a liberal society have a right to engage in meaningful work and earn a living wage? What is the changing nature of work in a neoliberal society? What are the goals of the state in regards to the production of a future workforce? What are the impacts of employment discrimination, occupational segregation, and wage disparity based on race or gender?

The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued.

Writing Human Rights explores human rights rhetoric through readings of a range of non-fiction, academic articles, and reportage, alongside fictional works. It asks students, through critical writing, to come to terms with our responsibilities as global citizens for upholding a culture of dignity in our world. As an Intensive Writing course, the main topic of the course is writing itself. Together, we will examine the way that authors use the written word to push readers to empathize with others, reflect on the past, learn about injustices, and imagine new realities as we do the same in our own writing. We will pay close attention to the way that writers build arguments, use evidence, organize texts, and edit their own work, with an eye on developing strategies for using these skills in class assignments, and transferring them to other classes as well. Through writing projects that analyze, challenge, and extend authors arguments about the universality of human rights and the pursuit of social and racial justice, we will evaluate the ways that words fuel and mitigate conflict in both productive and destructive ways. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings, and group work in the form of frequent peer review.",

    "description": "Students will learn how to read and write about anglophone poetry from different time periods by focusing on one particular poetic form: the sonnet. Students will have opportunities to engage with poets and the local poetry community, handle rare books, and learn how to use the librarys resources, with a view to writing both poetry reviews and argumentative essays about poetry. As one of the most enduring poetic forms in the Western tradition, the sonnet is a form that contemporary engage with in order to have a dialogue with poets from the past. Broadly defined, it is a poem with fourteen lines, a strict rhyme scheme, and the expectation that there will be a turn in the argument or logic of the poem at some point. These constraints have long been considered an opportunity for poets to display their technical skill. And yet, as Terrance Hayes puts it in his poem American Sonnet for my Past and Future Assassin, the sonnets constraints can also be part prison. Studying sonnets therefore opens up conversations about the kinds of games contemporary poets are playingand what kinds of critiques they are makingwhen they choose to experiment with this particular poetic form. We will begin by studying Tyehimba Jess Olio (2016). We will then go back to the very beginning of this tradition, to read translations of poems by the fourteenth-century Italian poet Petrarch, who invented the conventions that poets are still responding to today. In the third unit, we will study how early modern British writers, including William Shakespeare, Edmund Spenser, Lady Mary Wroth, and John Donne, adapted this Italian form in English, and consider reasons that the sonnet fell out of fashion, only to resurge in the late eighteenth-century. Finally, we will read twentieth and twenty-first century sonnets in dialogue with the earlier sonnets we have studied. This course will satisfy the departments requirement to take a pre-1800 class, but it is also open to anyone who is curious about poetic form and poetic tradition. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: The majority of class time will be spent close reading poetry together, both in class discussion and small group work. A significant amount of class time will also be spent introducing students to college-level research and writing skills. No previous knowledge of poetry or essay-writing will be assumedwe will build the skills needed to close read, do research, write essays, and attend poetry readings together. Course grades will take into account class participation as well as both formal and informal written assignments.",

    "description": "Poetry is an act of discovery. We write to discover what we don't know or understand about ourselves and the world around us. To make these discoveries we must pay attention: practice close observation, question our assumptions, and test our truths. We must also pay attention to whats happening in our bodies as we write: the breath, pulse and heartbeat that gives poetry life. When we practice embodied writing we include our whole selves in our creative work. In many ways, poetry is a kind of research, and not so different than other fields. In this class, we'll look at poems that have curiosity and attention at their core: scientific, historic, cultural and social. We'll develop our abilities as researchers and writers through on-site exercises, the cultivation of a writer's notebook, close readings and regular writing practice. We'll look at poems by poets such as Natasha Trethewey, Tishani Doshi, Aracelis Girmay, Chet'la Sebree, Layli Longsoldier, Danez Smith, Ross Gay and others, and make our own curious, embodied poem collections. The majority of our time will be spent practicing: there will be multiple writing assignments each week. Reading will be a crucial component of our efforts. Writing assignments and discussions of technique will be based in assigned texts. Both reading and writing assignments will address issues of form, musicality, syntax, imagery, diction and tone. The workshop format requires the constructive, critical attentions of each and every member of the class.  We will discuss the ground-rules and work out the logistics of our workshop during the first class. Everyone should expect to read their work aloud, and the work of others, in class, many times.

In response, the Holocaust refugee Tuvia Ruebner once said, its barbaric in the way that its barbaric that after a forest fire new trees grow. Adorno was right, said Ruebner, but poetry is so fundamental it bursts forth. This course will explore twentieth and twenty-first century poetry that responds to or otherwise grapples with catastrophe, from the Armenian genocide to the Holocaust; from the Nakba to the Vietnam War; from the Great Purge to the Rwandan genocide; and beyond. We will examine the role of literature and the arts in bearing witness. We will ask what poetry produced in conditions of extremity can tell us about the circumstances out of which they emerge, and how poems can be an alternative to historical narrative. Readings might include works by Anna Akhmatova, Paul Celan, Mahmoud Darwish, Edmond Jabes, Rokhl Korn, Osip Mandelstam, Dan Pagis, Muriel Rukeyser, Nelly Sachs, Wislawa Szymborksa, Vahan Tekeyan, Mosab Abu Toha, Marina Tsvetaeva, Tristan Tzara, and others. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close reading, independent research, oral presentation, and an emphasis on written work, both analytic and creative.",

First, in their words : we will look at how early twentieth-century writers described their own formal experiments and aesthetic agendas. This section will pair modernist manifestos and critical essays with fiction and poetry written by those same authors. Second, in their worlds : we will examine the historical, geographical, and cultural dimensions of these famous literary experiments. This section pairs modernist primary works with brief readings focused on World War I, colonization and decolonization, the Harlem Renaissance, and urban technology. When it comes to the dynamic relationship between words and worlds, our goal will be synthesis rather than separation. How does historical change relate to changes in literary form? Possible authors include Mulk Raj Anand, Joseph Conrad, T.S. Eliot, E.M. Forster, Langston Hughes, James Joyce, Nella Larsen, Katherine Mansfield, Ezra Pound, and Virginia Woolf.",

Beginning in the mid-twentieth century with Ralph Ellison's 1952 magnum opus Invisible Man, we will explore some of the major issues that have shaped the production of late African American literature, including the rise of various critical discourses (postmodernism, feminist theory, queer theory, black internationalism) as well as the influence of numerous twentieth and twenty-first century U.S. social movements (such as the civil rights, black power, women's rights, and black lives matter movements). Special attention will be paid to various new directions in the field of African American literature over the course of the past thirty years. We will likely engage with works of Ralph Ellison, Toni Morrison, Octavia Butler, Jesmyn Ward, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Ross Gay, Clint Smith, Roxanne Gay, and Alexis Pauline Gumbs, among others.

By emphasizing Asian American and Pacific Islander, this course foregrounds the and as a necessary tension between two groups that have been differently racialized. Some questions that will orient our engagement with these fields include: How does literature shape ideas about what it means to be Asian American or Pacific Islander? What is the role of discourse in (en)gendering ideas about East/West, Asia, the Pacific, and Otherness? And what methods do scholars of Asian American and Pacific critique draw on to analyze complex systems of race, empire, militarism, settler colonialism, and capitalism? Taking seriously the Black feminist literary critic Barbara Christians argument that literature for people of color has often constituted a form of theorizing, we will pair works of critical theory (by Lisa Lowe, Colleen Lye, Edward Said, Anne Anlin Cheng, Jodi Kim, J. Kehaulani Kauanui, Teresia Teaiwa, Epeli Hauofa, Haunani-Kay Trask, and more), with forms of literary theorizingin novels, poetry, performances, and essaysby canonical and contemporary authors including Monique Truong, Jessica Hagedorn, Nora Okja Keller, Ocean Vuong, Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, Albert Wendt, Craig Santos Perez, Julian Aguon, and more. At the end of the course, students will not only have a sense of how Asian American and Pacific studies complicate concepts of identity, belonging, and political power; they will also have an understanding of how those fields of study can help us imagine otherwise, as the critic Kandice Chuh puts it, moving us from the analysis of structures of power to creating possibilities for their transformation and reimagining. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: weekly reading journal entries, close reading, in-class small group and class discussions, essay writing, and oral presentations.",

We will study the Qurans literary qualities, including style, structure, unity, and eloquence, and we will study the Qurans protagonists, including the Biblical and Arabian prophets, and its narratives and themes. Further, we will try to understand the ways that the Quran violates rules of unity, harmony, and try to make sense of its abrupt changes of subject matter, interruptions or lack of continuities, and miscellaneous fragments by finding unity, coherence, and intelligibility in them. The inevitable question of how the Quran engages with the Biblical narratives and themes and how such pre-existent materials can help us interpret the Quran are just two of our areas of inquiry, but there are others too: Is the Quran prose or poetry? How can our analysis of the Quran as literature help us understand its religious meaning and message, including its conception of history, and its ideas of transcendent esoteric wisdom? The course covers the full trajectory of literary approaches to the Quran from roughly the ninth century until the present. We will begin by comparing the Quran to the most eloquent poetry of Ancient Arabia and end by analyzing the works of contemporary women interpreters of the Quran.

Assigned texts will include a range of sources (books, articles, podcasts, videos) from writing studies and a STEM discipline. As they read, listen to, and view materials, students will study the way sources balance rhetorical features (e.g., audience, purpose, context), with an eye on emulating the ways that published authors explain and analyze complicated material. Students can expect to hone their writing skills as well as their ability to use writing as a tool to build meaning in their work in STEM fields.",

The psalmist and Adrienne Rich ask these questions, which we will face while we read coming-of-age narratives that fit in a genre known by its German name, the Bildungsroman. These novels go beyond the pilgrimage out of adolescence, and into explicit representation of intellectual, aesthetic, and spiritual growth experienced in unison with sexual development, awakenings, thrills, mishaps, and marriage. We will pay attention to how we immerse ourselves into the condition of those who grow on the page; not to identify with the characters, but to accompany them. From our immersive accompaniment we will re-emerge intentionally to write about how we progress, digress, regress, and grow some more. As we read we will explore many terms and theoretical concerns: Erik Erickson on life stages; Donald Winnicott on holding environment and object relation; Jacques Lacan on mirrors and interminability of desire; Silvan Tomkins on affects and nuclear scripts; Shoshana Feldman on re-reading, unlearning, engendering, and again desire. Readings will likely include: Roland Barthes, A Lovers Discourse; Jeffrey Eugenides, The Marriage Plot; Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre; Ayad Akhtar, American Dervish; James Baldwin, Go Tell It on the Mountain; Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God; Richard Powers, The Overstory. The coursework includes four short pieces of writing and a substantial Capstone Project.

We will discuss how language shapes the ways in which we categorize other beings, such as animals and trees, as well as other humans. Our close reading of land and texts will enable us to see how our reading practices are shaped by language. Spring will take us to local waterways, including Amherst Colleges Wildlife Sanctuary and the Quabbin Reservoir, where we will read William Cronons classic essay, The Trouble with Wilderness in relation to these built environments. Lauret Savoys Trace will lead us to consider our embodied experiences and histories in relation to the places where we live. Throughout, we will grapple with critical questions. How are concepts like nature and culture intertwined with constructions of race and gender? How has the conservation of wilderness been entangled with colonial dispossession and removal?

    "description": "This course explores the life and writings of American author James Baldwin. Born in poverty-stricken Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance, Baldwin went on to become one of the twentieth centurys most influential essayists, novelists, orators, and political commentators---particularly around issues related to American race relations. Unapologetically black, queer, and radicalBaldwins writings have become a source of resurgent public interest, particularly in the wake of todays turbulent U.S. political climate. In this course we will study key moments in Baldwins oeuvre and situate the authors work in a variety of relevant historical contexts. We will pay particular attention to reoccurring themes that sit at the center of Baldwins political philosophy including: the power of love as an animating force for social transformation; the resilient nature of black resistance; the role and responsibility of artists- as-troublemakers; the limitations of white ally-ship, the dangers (and creative possibilities) of organized religion; and the ongoing problem of global white supremacy. In addition, we will place Baldwins writings in conversation with the voices of some of his contemporaries and literary progeny. One primary concern will be how to place Baldwins writings in conversation with current debates about race, gender, sexuality, and politics in contemporary America. Why does Baldwins work seem to resonate so forcefully with the social justice concerns of today and to what ends? Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on written work including weekly journal entries, readings, oral presentations, active in-class verbal participation, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, field work or trips, visual analysis, aural analysis, dramaturgical analysis, performance analysis.",

    "description": "From its very beginnings, the moving image has shared a close affinity with the uncanny  the strange, mysterious, or unfamiliar. Whether in its ability to preserve the images of people and places long since passed, its disorienting illusion of live-ness, or its fantastic depictions of impossible worlds, cinema has long elicited shock, amazement, and unease in its spectators. The affective responses conjured by tales of the supernatural are not limited to dread and terror; just as frequently, ghostly narratives elicit grief, loneliness, nostalgia, and fantasy  even pleasure. Cinema is not just an ideal format for the telling of supernatural tales  it is and has always been a haunted medium. This class explores supernatural media through the historical and affective intersection between cinema, technology, modern belief, and spectatorship. Students will engage with a range of international films and critical works drawn from literature, art history, film studies, cultural studies, and critical theory. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: The course will be lecture and discussion based, with particular emphasis on weekly readings and screenings. Students will maintain a Moodle discussion board and complete several short papers over the course of the semester.",

This course is designed to provide students with the skills necessary to analyze and create narrative feature film scripts, series, and shorts, with attention to mechanics and elegant design. Close readings of screenplays and films will seek to reveal how established writers are able to grip an audiences attention by building narrative questions, how plots are structured both within scenes and across an entire work, how resonant dialogue can effectively impart information and create subtext, and how characters relate to plot. Classes will combine textual analysis, writing instruction, in-class exercises, and peer review. Students will complete three short scripts (2-3 pages) with extensive revision. These scripts can either be independent scenes, or related scenes of a longer script (no more than ten pages total). Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings, independent research, oral presentations, group work, artistic work, audio-visual analysis, revision, self-evaluation.",

    "description": "[Before 1800] Although many people believe that they know themselves better than anyone else does, it is difficult to say exactly what a self is. Some people believe true selves only emerge in public or in relationships, while others believe that the true self is one we tend to keep private (or to ourselves). To try to define selfhood is to encounter a series of paradoxes. Even if we tend to praise those who are self-aware, for instance, its paradoxically not so good to be self-conscious, or too sure-of-oneself. How does the idea that we become different selves in different roles square with the theory of the self? In this class, we will think about this question historically, and read various theories of how selfhood emerged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and what literature had to do with this. A central theme will be the question of how autobiographical and faux-autobiographical literature works as a tool of self-discovery. We will consider how race, class, and gender affected the formation of selves in this period. We will also consider the question of how far the self is defined by the advent of other concepts that became central to the production of literature in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, such as character, privacy, identity, inwardness, and interiority. For instance, we will think about how changes to the architecture of both domestic space and city life led, in turn, to new ways of writing, and new spaces for inner life to flourish. Primary texts students will encounter in this class include (for example) the poetry of John Donne and John Milton, the diary of Samuel Pepys, the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and Mary Princes account of what it was like to be enslaved in the eighteenth century. No prior knowledge of early texts will be assumed. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Assignments will require some experience of writing essays in English.",

By focusing attention on the historical context of these figures or movements, the course will enable students to develop an understanding of both film theory and historical analysis. Our purpose will be to ground theory in history, recognizing both how critical and theoretical work cultivates complex ideas about media forms and how considering such work in a historical context allows us to understand the origins and even urgency of theoretical debates. This course will focus on Siegfried Kracauer in America, introducing students to the polyvalent work of German film scholar Siegfried Kracauer. Students will read Kracauers writings alongside those of his peers and contemporaries, such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor W. Adorno, and Margaret Mead. Students can expect to read widely, from primary sources to archival materials, and produce a substantial research paper by semesters end. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: This course is designed primarily for advanced FAMS/English majors; however students in other programs are encouraged to apply for the class if the topic interests them. Reading materials will derive almost exclusively from Kracauers writings and those of his contemporaries. The goal is to immerse students in Kracauers work to understand his place in twentieth century history, his contributions to the development of film studies, and the particular intellectual milieu in which he worked. The class is as much an introduction to intellectual history as it is an overview of Kracauers work. Students will design and carry out research projects drawing on primary sources made available in the class, from the readings themselves to archival documents provided by the instructor.",

Students will read from various genres, including memoir, essay, fiction, poetry, and hybrid writings, while trying out various interdisciplinary methods, such as ethnography, archival historiography, talk-story, oral histories, and fieldwork. This is a seminar, which means the course will center student discussions of literary and scholarly texts. Students will develop their own individual research projects throughout the semester through a series of assignments that involve writing place, writing the body, proposing a lengthy research project, curating a research bibliography, and composing a research paper.

But their underlying causes are often global: coal-burning power plants in China affects sea-level rise near Miami, overfishing by European fleets off the coast of Africa affects bush meat hunting in the Congo Basin, and deforestation in Indonesia creates forest fires that affect all of Southeast Asias air quality. Environmental issues are also fundamentally political: that is, they emerge through negotiations between different actors and groups with divergent interests and disparate degrees of power and influence. In this course, we will examine how environmental problems emerge through political processes that transcend national borders. Through foundational readings, in-depth classroom discussions, and team-based analysis of pressing contemporary cases, you will learn the tools of rigorous multi-level political and policy analysis. While we will emphasize that a global and explicitly political analysis is necessary to properly diagnose why environmental problems and conflicts emerge, we will focus on how these diagnoses suggest solutions . Coming out of this course, you will be better equipped to analyze how global politics are linked to local environmental issues, and to understand when different types of solutions from small changes to policy, to international treaties, to protest and demands for radical systems change are most likely to move the needle on environmental sustainability and justice.

On the one hand, we will examine processes of establishing power by exclusion, such as the race-thinking that coalesced around Jewish and Muslim believers or the strong hierarchies built to privilege men. On the other hand, this course also considers the inconsistencies of these systems of domination, including how women resisted patriarchal dominance and the intimate social, political, and cultural entanglements between different faith communities. In exploring these elements of the medieval world, we will encounter thirsty monks, naughty nuns, clout chasing popes, black saints, and all manner of other diverse individuals who articulated capacious notions of self, other, and the world. Finally, this course attends to the ramifications of medieval European history on the future of the globe. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close analysis of historical evidence, which may include written documents, images, music, films, or statistics from the historical period under study.

Spaniards have been at the vanguard of anti-fascism from the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s, to the fight against Nazi genocide during World War II, to opposition to the populist Trump-inspired Vox party of the twenty-first century. This course will consider the men and women of diverse political beliefs who risked their lives to put down fascist movements in Spain and throughout Europe. Through an examination of primary sources such as memoirs, photographs, and newspapers as well as contemporary films, graphic novels, television, and social media, we will explore resistance tactics, international espionage, and anti-fascism through the lens of gender, revisionist histories, and the long-lasting legal and social implications of attempts to thwart authoritarian oppression. This course will also consider the legacy of fascism and anti-fascism in Spain, tracking the influence on the present-day international Antifa and contemporary social justice movements.

As Eisenstein postulated in 1939, \"the method of cinema, when fully comprehended, will enable us to reveal an understanding of the method of art in general.\" In our effort to comprehend his work and enduring relevance, we will consider Eisenstein's stylistics through attentive viewing of his key films: Strike, Battleship Potemkin, October, Old and New, the never completed Que viva Mexico !, Alexander Nevsky, and Ivan the Terrible. Along with examining their formal features and rich historical and ideological contexts, we will also consider Eisenstein's theoretical texts on cinema and culture, attending in particular to his theories of montage, method, and his writings on the histories of literature and art. The course aims to situate his work within the broad aesthetic, philosophical, and political currents of his time, which he reflected upon in his work, and to which he, a quintessential modernist, made his distinctive and influential contributions.

    "description": "Essay filmmaking is a dynamic form with many commonly cited attributesthe presence of an authorial voice, an emphasis on broad themes, an eclectic approach to genre, and the tendency to digress or draw unexpected connections. Yet, true to its nature, the precise definition of the essay film is in constant flux. It can be both personal and political, individual and collective, noble and mischievous. Essay filmmakers themselves are equally diverse, ranging from established film auteurs to Third Cinema activists and contemporary video artists. If we entertain the notion that the processes of cinema closely resemble the mechanics of human thought, then the essay film may be the mediums purest expression. To watch or make such a film, we must give ourselves over to a compulsive, restless energy that delights in chasing a subject down any number of rabbit holes and blind alleys, often stopping to admire the scenery on the way. As with thought, there is no end product, no clear boundaries, no goal but the activity itself. The term \"essay\" finds its origins in the French essayer, meaning to attempt or to try. In this advanced production workshop, we will read, screen and discuss examples of the essayistic mode in literature and cinema while making several such attempts of our own. Students will complete a series of writing assignments and video projects informed by class materials and group discussion. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on artistic practice, personal writing, group critique, critical readings and film screenings.",

    "description": "As an advanced seminar in Film and Media Studies, this course will explore particular figure(s), movements, and/or institutions which have been central to the development of film theory and criticism. By focusing attention on the historical context of these figures or movements, the course will enable students to develop an understanding of both film theory and historical analysis. Our purpose will be to ground theory in history, recognizing both how critical and theoretical work cultivates complex ideas about media forms and how considering such work in a historical context allows us to understand the origins and even urgency of theoretical debates. This course will focus on Siegfried Kracauer in America, introducing students to the polyvalent work of German film scholar Siegfried Kracauer. Students will read Kracauer's writings alongside those of his peers and contemporaries, such as Hannah Arendt, Theodor W. Adorno, and Margaret Mead. Students can expect to read widely, from primary sources to archival materials, and produce a substantial research paper by semester's end. Reading materials will derive almost exclusively from Kracauer's writings and those of his contemporaries. The goal is to immerse students in Kracauer's work to understand his place in twentieth century history, his contributions to the development of film studies, and the particular intellectual milieu in which he worked. The class is as much an introduction to intellectual history as it is an overview of Kracauer's work. Students will design and carry out research projects drawing on primary sources made available in the class, from the readings themselves to archival documents provided by the instructor.",

To attenuate their criticisms of the social, political, and religious structures of the ancien regime, they had recourse to the viewpoint of fictional \"outsiders\" who arrive in France as if for the first time and describe what they see in minute and telling detail. We will analyze the role that these \"other\" worlds and the \"otherworldly\" point of view played in the development of eighteenth-century thought and literature, as well as some of the repercussions that these questions have had in twentieth-century thought. Readings will include Montesquieu's Lettres persanes, Rousseau's Discours sur l'origine de l'inegalite, Diderot's Supplement au Voyage de Bougainville, and Madame de Graffigny's Lettres d'une Peruvienne, as well as Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents and a selection of essays by Claude Levi-Strauss.

    "description": "As we find ourselves today in a world on fire, one wracked by pollution, overconsumption, and habitat destruction, it has become difficult to avoid serious doubt about the nature and future of humanity. How did we get here? How can we and the earth make it out alive? For writers and philosophers working at the intersection of the sciences and the humanities, the answer to these questions has to do with our self-concept as human beings. To save the planet, we must query our ordinary understanding of the human and embrace nonhuman forms of subjectivity: we must become posthuman. Viewing human life through the anti-anthropocentric lenses of physics, biology, or systems theory will correct the distortions of anthropocentrism, provide us with a clearer view of our situation on Earth, and even furnish new forms of ethics. Yet how can we reconcile the nonhuman perspective of science with the human perspective of ordinary life? What would it be like to live a posthuman life? We will explore these questions by reading French theories of the posthuman alongside posthuman fictions, considering in the process what it might mean to see humans as matter in motion, as animals, or as networks of becoming.

We will develop an understanding of the atmospheric, oceanographic, geological, and biological systems that interact to modulate the climate.

Exploration of the sedimentary rock record, in which evidence of the history of ancient climate and life is preserved, will inform our inquiry into the ongoing climate experiment humanity is running through the rapid release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The scientific tools we develop will allow us to analyze predictions of future climate change and assess possible paths forward. This is an introductory science course designed for all students of the college. It provides a foundation for further study of Earths climate and surface environments. Three hours of class and two hours of lab. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: group work, lab work, field trips, quantitative work.",

The anticipated results of this process are thoughtfully assembled maps and geographic datasets that serve as accessible, persuasive, and even beautiful means of conveying large amounts of complex information. Geospatial thinking is a critical skill for pursuing a systems-based perspective on our rapidly changing and interconnected world. This course is a hands-on introduction to geospatial inquiry using geographic information systems (GIS) software applied to a variety of intersecting topics in environmental studies, natural science, and the humanities. Technical topics include geospatial data acquisition and database management, coordinate systems and projections, creation and manipulation of raster and vector datasets, data digitization, incorporation of field data into GIS, use of lidar, aerial imagery, and other remote sensing tools, and the production of professional-quality final maps. While there is a lecture component in the course, students will mainly be engaged in active learning in the form of skills tutorials, reflection and discussion assignments, independent and peer troubleshooting, and question-driven projects. Three hours of class and two hours of lab.

    "description": "Minerals are the fundamental building blocks of planetary materials, are essential natural resources for human society, and they modulate earth and environmental systems. This course explores the origin, distribution, and scientific and societal relevance of minerals. Through project-based inquiry, students will investigate the chemical and physical properties of minerals across a range of spatial scales, from the scale of individual atoms, to that of a hand specimen. We will use physical and chemical observations of minerals to infer the processes and environments that lead to their formation, and how minerals exert a first-order control on large scale geologic processes, from earths core to the human environment. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Lab exercises will involve hands-on experience in: recognizing 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional crystallographic patterns, identifying minerals using hand-sample specimens, optical microscopes, and the scanning electron microscope, as well as the application of mineral identification to quantitative and qualitative problem solving. In-class, active-learning exercises and problem sets will foster an inclusive learning community. Reflection assignments will ask participants to deeply engage with the course content and become aware of how they are learning. There will be two open-note, asynchronous, learning assessments that assess students' understanding of concepts, and the integration of the concepts. A collaborative research project involving reading of peer-reviewed literature and a 20-25 minute oral presentation will allow students to explore how the study of minerals is integral to all sub-disciplines in geoscience.",

    "description": "Before the boundaries between physics and geology were drawn, those who studied the Earth system were natural philosophers -- scientists who sought order in the cosmos through quantitative description of the world around us. Despite the modern disciplinary labels, physics and geology are still intertwined, as physical laws form the basis for explaining and exploring Earths most fundamental systems. In this course, we will use the physicists tool kit to investigate questions in tectonics, seismology, hydrology, and climate. We will collect data using concepts in acoustics, electromagnetics, and gravitation, which allow us to characterize the Earth in four dimensions. Finally, we will use these observations to understand energy and mass flow at all scales, exploring questions about the interior of our planet, the top of our atmosphere, and everything in between. This class will be a quantitative exploration of the Earth system, and is designed to help build physics-based intuition in the geosciences. Specific math, physics, and/or geology course work is not required; these skills will be built during the course. Three hours of class and three hours of lab each week. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on group work, field work, quantitative work, in-class quizzes and/or exams.",

    "description": "Once upon a time, two brothers travelled the land, searching for the magic words that would make children smile. Their names were Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, the land was Germany, and what they found were fairy tales like Rapunzel, Snow White, and Little Red Riding Hood. Today, the Brothers Grimm and their Childrens and Household Tales are a household name, with millions of copies sold and an official status as UNESCO world heritage. But how did we get to happily ever after? Was it really so happy? Whats fact and whats fiction, and who decides? First, we will get to know the texts from the Grimms editions, as well as the wider cultural and historical contexts for their work, such as the Napoleonic Wars, the revolutions of 1848, and the societal upheavals of industrialization, modern media, and urban life. Next, we will consider precursors to this narrative tradition in Europe and beyond, which served as sourcesand crucially, challengesfor the Grimms own views of the genre in matters of gender, class, and race. Finally, well follow the tales transformations through the twentieth century and some of the theories used to explain them in scholarship. Students beware, the history of German fairy tales is as dark and twisted as the stories themselves! How to handle overenrollment: German majors have priority. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: an emphasis on written work, close reading, oral presentations, group work, field trips, textual analysis, visual analysis, seminar-style discussions.

    "description": "In this course, artworks, in the broadest sense of the term, will provide entry points to the city of Berlin. With countless historic sites within its cityscape marking pivotal moments in German history, Berlin offers a unique landscape for the critical examination of both past and present. Especially since the fall of the Wall and Berlins reinstatement as the German capital, the city has led efforts to shape a new national identity and culture. And yet, Berlin is also home to the countrys largest migrant population, and remains what it has long been: a city of varied cultural influences. Throughout the semester, we will examine how these cultural influences manifest themselves in the arts, as well as at historical sites within the built environment of the city. Each week will be centered around one work of art, film, literature, song, theater or architecture that re/presents Berlin-specific histories and has triggered controversial public debates in Germany. We will trace these debates in German news sources, art/culture magazines, and radio broadcasts, analyzing them alongside critical theory readings. Special attention will be paid to migrant and minority artists engaging with questions of national identity, belonging, exclusion, otherness, and race within their works. Conducted in German.

Since WWII most of historical studies of the Far-Right have focused on the history of fascism, from proto-fascism to neo-fascism. in the twenty-first century; however, the Far-Right emerges as a much broader phenomenon, in chronology, in geography, and in attributes. Consequently, this course considering the Far-Right a global phenomenon of the modern age will study a selection of case studies from different continents and centuries. Beyond acknowledging their inner variety, we will also seek the impact of Far-Right networks across space, and inspiration across time in each of these case studies. Seeking a better understanding of the Far-Right, its agenda and appeal, the course will look for that which unites Far-Right actors across different historical contexts.

The history of medicine was long viewed as the study of the development of new approaches to disease prevention and treatment. However, pathbreaking scholarship on the racist roots of American medicine has called for an examination of how broader social, cultural, and political norms and values shaped medical training and practices. Slavery and colonialism transformed early modern medicine. Specialists in gynecology and obstetrics led the attack on healers and midwives while using enslaved women to practice their methods. This group became leaders of the organized movement to elevate the status of university-trained doctors. We will explore the history and legacy of the American Medical Association in launching the first coordinated campaign against abortion. We will examine the eugenics movement and its effects on those it viewed as racially inferior and/or sexually deviant, including the forced sterilization of BIPOC women and the new classification of homosexuality as a mental disorder. We will study the growth of psychiatry as a specialty, its propagation of abuse against LGBTQ people in the form of lobotomies, electroshock treatment, aversion and conversion therapies, and its legacy as the root of modern homophobia and transphobia. Medical stigma, discrimination, and bias have had profound and devastating consequences for generations of people denied access to lifesaving treatment and care, from the criminalization of abortion to the Tuskegee experiments to HIV/AIDS to transgender healthcare.",

Focusing on rights within the United States, this course will explore how the United States has sought to balance these competing concerns in the past, and the implications of this history for contemporary debates. We will examine the shifting meaning of 'national security' and how it has changed at key moments in the nations history. We will also analyze how debates over national security and rights have reflected broader partisan divides, served diverse political objectives, and reflected competing visions of national identity and purpose. The shifting relationship between these two imperatives addresses the central purpose and dilemma of democratic governance: to advance the collective good while ensuring basic freedoms for all individuals. The course will initially survey these issues through a historical lens, demonstrating how questions of security and rights have been present since the nations founding.

This course will investigate the dynamism of Latin American societies beginning in the ancient or pre-conquest period and ending with the collapse of European rule in most Spanish, Portuguese, and French speaking territories in the New World. We will explore this history through the eyes of various historical actors, including politicians, explorers, noble men and women, indigenous intellectuals, and African slaves. In addition to interrogating the myriad of peaceable and creative cross-cultural exchanges and interactions that characterized the relationship between these groups, we will also explore how conflict, exploitation, and natural disaster shaped the Colonial Latin American experience.

    "description": "The transition from white-minority rule in South Africa in 1994 ushered in a new era of independence and democracy in a troubled country whose name had become synonymous with apartheid. Yet that transition has not lived up to the high expectations of South Africans as many of the ruling structures built by the colonial and then apartheid regimes have endured, and economic and social inequality has increased in the nearly thirty years since Nelson Mandela was first elected President. Questions about whether South Africans can move beyond the legacy of the past haunt the current population. New interpretations of South African history have emerged as new generations of historians write the past. This course will explore established and emerging themes in the history of this fascinating country. We will cover a broad period from just before the beginning of white settlement in the mid-1600s to the present. The focus will be on understanding how South African populations have confronted and engaged with colonial rule, profound cultural changes, and the development of an oppressively unequal economic and political system. What are the roots of the current situation, and how do they shape and constrain future possibilities? How do people in contemporary South Africa confront the ideas that have shaped their understanding of their own country as they reconstruct their history? Analyze the historical construction of social difference in South Africa from the early 1600s to the present, including the precolonial, colonial, apartheid, and independent (post-1994) eras. Identify how social categories, including class, race, and gender, changed over time and explain how these categories informed the experiences of people living in southern Africa. Identify different forms of discrimination and assess how structural racism, sexism and classism have evolved and contributed to the development of political, social, and economic inequality. By the end of the semester, students will have critically analyzed a range of primary and secondary sources; engaged in both open and structured discussions with their classmates; written two short papers and eight Moodle posts in response to assigned readings; and written one 10-page research paper on an individually chosen topic relating to southern Africa.",

Art, trade, small-scale manufacturing, medical knowledge, religion, state systems, history, and legend all flourished before the formal political take-over of the continent by European powers in the late nineteenth century. We will explore this varied history of states and cultures in the African past. The course will focus primarily on the period between 1400 and 1885 by discussing four topics in depth: labor systems within African societies and the impact of both the trans-Atlantic and East African trades in enslaved people; the impacts of religion and political power on the rise and fall of the central African kingdom of Kongo; the genesis of the Zulu state in southern Africa and historical debates about the regional impact of the Zulu state's expansion; and the changing roles of women as economic, political, and social actors. We will discuss differences between oral and written narratives to understand how Africans actively interpreted their histories and how later historians have re-interpreted, re-written, and occasionally silenced these earlier narratives.

Covered fields include biology, physics, geology, chemistry, and meteorology. Close readings of seminal works will show us how different archival efforts revealed unexpected influences behind notable scientific events: the production of the atomic bombs, the invention of electricity, Charles Darwins ideas of evolution, the development of protocol feminism, and the discovery of oxygen. Portrayed primarily as European and North American enterprises, these scientific fields grew by borrowing knowledge from every corner of the world. We will learn from historians how to capture the cosmopolitan and yet parochial character of science in our work: expounding on the role indigenous groups, local circumstances, collections in museums, and voyages around the world played in the construction of objective scientific theories. Lastly, we explore how to interpret the informal lab, field, and collecting notes produced in the course of this scientific work by recreating long forgotten scientific practices. Our approach, thus, will be enactive: we will spend time combing through archives, dive into museum basements, and traverse fields to experience how 'writing history' and 'doing science' overlap in important ways.

Learn to use technical scientific details to produce better historical research whilst making rigorous archival research engaging for a broad audience. Students are expected to produce short weekly essays on critical readings, two in-depth essays presenting new literature in the history of science, four hands-on workshop experiments, and a multi-medium work in history of science aimed at the general public.",

How do we claim to know anything about the past at all? How do historians construct the stories they tell about the past from the fragmentary remnants of former times? What is the connection between the past as it was lived and the narratives that historians write? How do we judge the truth and value of these histories and memories? The course explores questions such as these through readings and case studies drawn from a variety of places and times. Throughout the semester, we will examine a variety of subjects, from the heroic yet complicated life of noted abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to the clashing worldviews of Hawaiians and Europeans at the time of Captain Cooks Pacific explorations, from debates over the motivations of perpetrators in the Holocaust to contrasting interpretations of Chinese footbinding. To be explicit, though: our object in reading these books is not to learn their subject matter. If you gain a better understanding of these historical events through our readings, great but that is not the goal of the course. Rather, our aim is to study the discipline of History itself, looking closely at how the historians writing these texts tried to make and discover knowledge. This approach will allow us to grapple with a number of significant philosophical questions that still dominate the study of the past. Is there such a thing as historical truth? Is it appropriate for historians to have a political agenda? What does it mean for a history, or a historian, to be biased? To what extent is history a useful lens for understanding the present? Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Exploration of methodological and theoretical debates about the writing of historical scholarship.

    "description": "The Shahnameh (Book of Kings), completed by Abul Qasim Ferdowsi around 1010, is one of the world's greatest epics, and also one of the most enigmatic. The Shahnameh tells the history of pre-Islamic Iran from the beginnings of civilization until the Arab conquest in the seventh century A.D. Its tales of battles, romance, heroism, and betrayal have been appreciated as literature for centuries. At the same time, it has been deployed for political and cultural ends. Many of the communities who have most enthusiastically embraced its stories and themes have been of non-Iranian origin. Indeed, Ferdowsi's patron, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni, was himself of Turkic background. Since the nineteenth century, it has been touted as the cultural cornerstone of an emphatically non-Muslim modern Iranian national identity, and yet the author and his patron were Muslim. Some have even interpreted the Shahnameh as encouraging conversion to Islam. This course will explore the Shahnameh as literature, history, and material culture including illustrated manuscripts, printed books, ceramics, metalwork, and posters from Ferdowsi's tenth-century context to the contemporary moment. We will focus in particular on a heavily illustrated mid-nineteenth-century printed copy of the Shahnameh made in Mumbai (formerly Bombay), India, now in Amherst College's Archives and Special Collections, and consider how this work expressed a non-Islamic cultural foundation of modernity. We will follow this story to explore how the Shahnameh figures in debates over the pre-Islamic past today. No previous background is presumed, and all readings are available in English. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on close reading, written work, visual analysis, independent research, group work, field trips.",

    "description": "Often overshadowed by the long 1960s and the conservative ascendancy of the 1980s, the 1970s provides an important transitional moment for the United States, one that arguably linked local experiences to global dynamics and social movements in unprecedented ways. It was also a decade fraught with contradictions. On the one hand, Americans experienced widespread disillusionment with the power of the federal government to promote and protect the minority from the majority. Historians seeking to understand the collapse of the welfare state or the origins of white resistance to civil rights initiatives most often point to the 1970s as the time when the Supreme Court abandoned school desegregation and the federal government shifted the burden of the social welfare system onto the market, state and local governments, and onto poor people themselves. And yet, the 1970s also saw an explosion of progressive social activism, as the womens movement, the gay rights movement, and the environmental movement, among others, all came into their own. Likewise, this was also a time when U.S. realignment internationally and military overextension intersected with new hegemonies of human rights regimes, multinational corporations, and globalization. This course will emphasize a wide array of social movements and activismboth left and rightand the interplay among formal politics, grassroots organizing, and popular culture. It will ask students to consider how the 1970s catalyzed many of the domestic and international dynamics and debates that define American politics and society today. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close analysis of historical evidence, which may include written documents, images, music, films, or statistics from the historical period under study. Exploration of scholarly, methodological, and theoretical debates about historical topics. Extensive reading, varying forms of written work, and intensive in-class discussions.",

    "description": "Nationalism by far the most powerful political idea of the past 250 years has transformed human history the world over. By positing a new form of human identity, it has liberated and enslaved, built and destroyed. Most importantly it persisted by presenting itself as a natural fact of human life. Studying nationalism, therefore, is an act of self-exploration, whether we regard ourselves as national or not. Yet, though nationalism has shaped the modern age, people strongly disagree on its most basic concepts: What are nations? When did they emerge? What is their future? This research seminar will begin with a systematic and comparative study of the key theories of nationalism, seeking to understand both their claims and historical contexts. From this theoretical foundation, the seminar will explore case studies from different epochs and continents. Further: more than focusing on nationalisms impact on politics, our case studies will illustrate nationalisms impact on gender norms and class, on religion and philosophy, on culture and the arts. Finally the course will culminate in individual student research projects, consisting of a 25-page research paper and a final presentation as part of a mini-conference event. One class meeting per week. Research seminars require independent research, including the framing of a research question, and the identification and analysis of relevant primary and secondary sources. History majors must write a 20-25 page, evidence-based paper.",

We will read major works that chart the history of the very concepts of race, gender, and sexuality. We will explore how these ideas were both advanced and contested by various groups over the years by reading primary sources such as newspaper articles, personal letters, court records, and organizational papers. Movements for womens rights, racial justice, and LGBTQ liberation have dramatically shaped these debates and their implications. In particular, feminist theory, critical race theory, and queer theory provide powerful arguments about how we formulate research questions, what constitutes a legitimate archive, and why writing history matters. Students will learn to identify and work with an archive to craft a major research paper in some aspect of U.S. history while engaging the relevant historic arguments about race, gender, and/or sexuality.

    "description": "Heritage learners of Spanish are students who have grown up speaking, listening, reading and/or writing Spanish with family or in their community. Because of their unique backgrounds, Spanish heritage language learners (SHLLs) are bilingual and bicultural. They function between a Hispanic and an American identity. This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups. With this in mind, through meaningful activities that focus on students experiences and emotions, this Spanish language course will center on bilingualism, specifically through writing, as a necessary means for identity formation. Because in narrating our stories with others, we enact our identities, this course will include an event open to the community that showcases our voices and talents. Through this course, students will incorporate their personal experience as SHLLs into their coursework. Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity. Using a student-centered approach, the course will include collaborative brainstorming, free-writing, developing topics of personal importance, and peer and group editing in order to develop students writing proficiency and to build community. This course prepares Spanish heritage language students for advanced-level courses offered by the Spanish Department. The class will be conducted entirely in Spanish, though some assignments can be submitted in English. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: an emphasis on written work, readings, oral presentations, independent research, group work, instruction in languages other than English, visual and aural analysis.",

This course will investigate the dynamism of Latin American societies beginning in the ancient or pre-conquest period and ending with the collapse of European rule in most Spanish, Portuguese, and French speaking territories in the New World. We will explore this history through the eyes of various historical actors, including politicians, explorers, noble men and women, indigenous intellectuals, and African slaves. In addition to interrogating the myriad of peaceable and creative cross-cultural exchanges and interactions that characterized the relationship between these groups, we will also explore how conflict, exploitation, and natural disaster shaped the Colonial Latin American experience. Through a mixture of lecture, small and large group activities, and analysis of primary and secondary sources we will also consider how historians understand the past as well as the foundational debates which shape our current interpretations of colonial Latin American history.

    "description": "Murder is the most serious offense against the legal order and is subject to its most punitive responses. It gives meaning to law by establishing the limits of laws authority and its capacity to tame violence.  Murder is, in addition, a persistent theme in literature and popular culture where it is used to organize narratives of heroism and corruption, good and evil, fate and irrational misfortune. This course uses law, literature, and popular culture to develop their skills in reading, critical analysis of texts, and writing. We will examine the legal definition of homicide and compare that crime with other killings which law condemns (assisted suicide) as well as those it tolerates (killing in self-defense) or itself carries out (police use of lethal force and capital punishment). We will explore various types of murders (e.g. school shootings, terrorism, serial killing and genocide) and inquire into the motives of those who commit these acts. In addition, we will consider representations of murder in literature and film.  Can such representations ever adequately capture murder, the murderer, and the fear that both arouse? In addition to numerous court cases course materials will include Truman Capote, In Cold Blood, Toni Morrison, Beloved, and Hannah Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem as well as such films as Menace 2 Society, Unforgiven, and Silence of the Lambs. Throughout, we will ask what we can learn about law and culture from the way both imagine, represent, and respond to murder. We will focus on the fundamentals of writing style and of helping students develop clear and persuasive writing styles. Along with regular in class writing, frequent short papers will be assigned. Students will be expected to attend regular writing consultations.

    "description": "Nature is at once among the most basic of concepts and among the most ambiguous. Law is often called upon to clarify the meaning of nature. In doing so it raises questions about what it means to be human. This course is organized around three questions. First, what does law as a humanistic discipline say about nature? Second, what can laws conception of nature tell us about shifting conceptions of humanness? Third, what can we learn by attending to these questions about laws own situation in the world and its ability to tell us who we are? We will address these questions by starting with the environment (specifically wilderness). We will then expand our view of nature by examining legal engagements with animals (endangered species, animals in scientific experiments, and pets), human bodies (reproductive technologies, involuntary biological alterations, the right to die) and brains (genetic or hormonal bases for criminal defenses). Throughout, we will focus our attention on the themes of knowledge, control and change. We will look, for example, at relationships between legal and scientific forms of knowledge and the problematic role of expert knowledge in adjudicating normative disputes. We will also look at laws response to radical, technologically induced changes in relations between humans and nature, and to arguments in favor of limiting such transformations. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Written work, Quizzes, exams, Class participation, Readings",

    "description": "Fearlessly independent, tenaciously unclassifiable, frequently controversial, and always thought-provoking, Hannah Arendt (1906-1975) is without question one of the greatest thinkers of the twentieth century. Setting aside the conventional interpretation of Arendt as a political theorist, this course will focus on Arendts contributions to the study of law, with special attention to Arendts unusual inquiries into human rights, international criminal law, constitutional law, and civil disobedience. By carefully reading select writings by Arendt alongside key events in twentieth century history, we shall trace in Arendts texts a relation between thought, crisis, and judgment that is often occluded by the dominant reception of her thought. Along the way, we shall ask how Arendt arrived at her various judgments, what it means for thought to relate to law and to the world, and why judgment might offer a way to respond to, and live through, the crises of ones present.

Moving from the moment of Constitutional founding, through the American Civil War and the abolition of slavery, Jim Crow and the early Civil Rights Movement, encounters in the racial politics of feminism and reproductive justice, the jurisprudence of labor, welfare, and carcerality in the neoliberal era, and the development of antidiscrimination jurisprudence, we will study alongside thinkers in Critical Race Theory, Black Feminist thought, and other twentieth and twenty-first century anti-racisms in order to understand the possibilities and limits of law today.

    "description": "The political, economic, and philosophical figure of the death sentence, although it has archaic roots, continues to haunt the twenty-first century. Athens killed the philosopher Socrates because he was dangerous to the polis, and philosophy has enshrined this death sentence as both its mythical origin and its most modern moment. Having cut off the head of the king, French revolutionaries and their critics fiercely debated whether mercy or execution would better distance their new social order from repressive forms of monarchical sovereignty. The murder and vulnerability to premature death of Africans in the Atlantic Slave Trade and Native and indigenous peoples in the Americas underwrote and enabled the idea of the New World and its fraught and partial freedoms. Together we will inquire into the logics these stories, and their accompanying, often paradoxical, discourses (punishment, mercy; sovereignty, technique), have in common. Turning to contemporary theory, we will seek to understand the persistence of death sentences today. Why does the state kill, and what can the persistence of such violence both as fact and idea tell us about the idea of the state? Why did barbaric practices not end with enlightenment, the critique of religion, scientific rationalism, legal modernization, capitalism? What is the relation between capital punishment and other death sentences meted out in and through prisons, policing, or pandemics? In distinction from a course that debates American capital punishment primarily from a policy perspective, we will inquire into capital punishment as a problem for the history and writing of legal thought, inquiring after its persistence in philosophic terms and reconsidering the possible bases for abolitionist critique. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: engaging with, summarizing, and synthesizing theoretical and historical material, writing papers, and participating in discussion through small group work and close reading in class.",

    "description": "This course will introduce students to the field of international law by considering its historical and contemporary entanglements with empire and imperialism. International law has played a foundational role in articulating the norms that govern relations between the West and the Global South. It contributed, in particular, to authorizing various legal forms of imperial domination, from the early modern laws of conquest down to present ideologies of empire. Conversely, the logic of empire has been a driving force shaping the contours of contemporary international law, its doctrines, principles, and theories. The course will examine the relationship between international law and empire through two related lenses. Historically, by exploring the multifarious manifestations of international law in imperial settings. Historiographically, by delving into one of international laws most influential critical traditions: Third World Approaches to International Law (TWAIL). As members of a radical intellectual and political movement, TWAIL scholars argue that international law has constructed, entrenched, and furthered political and economic subordination around the globe. At its heart, their approach has been aimed at remaking international law on nonhierarchical grounds, empowering communities outside of the West to shape the international legal system to better serve a broader range of interests. By studying how international institutions and norms regulate issues like migration, armed conflict, environmental degradation, and more, we will seek to understand the TWAIL critique while also contemplating its limits.",

It does so in the face of growing international pressure for abolition and of evidence that the system for deciding who lives and who dies is fraught with error. This seminar is designed to expose students to America's death penalty as a researchable subject. It will be organized to help students understand how research is framed in this area, analyze theories and approaches of death penalty researchers, and identify open questions and most promising lines of future research. It will focus on the following dimensions of America's death penalty: its history, current status, public support/opposition, the processing of capital cases in the criminal justice system, race and capital punishment, and its impact and efficacy. During the seminar, each student will develop a prospectus for a research project on America's death penalty.

This question the question of the ordering of knowledge and its implications lies at the heart of Edward Saids Orientalism (1978). Nearly fifty years after its publication, it is hard to find a discipline in the humanities and the social sciences that has not been influenced by its powerful interventions. In this analytic seminar, we will use Saids book as our guide to explore the entanglements of orientalism and the law. We will explore how the production, representation, and codification of modern knowledge shapes our understanding of what law can and cannot be. We will also examine the various ways in which the language and categories of law produce and sustain the distinction between the West and its Others. The historical stage for this examination, as in Saids book, will be the encounter between the European West and the (Islamic, Asian) Orient.

    "description": "By exposing structures of domination and coercion and undermining the beliefs and values which sustain them, Marxists seek to pave the way towards radical social transformation. Tensions arise between revolutionary politics and the rule of law; liberals revere and authoritarians impose. The Marxist critique of capitalism necessarily involves inquiry into law, since legal relations are mutually constitutive with other social relations and law is a crucial component in the totality of capitalist social relations. While Karl Marx never produced a comprehensive theory of law, state, and rights, there is much in his work and in the broader Marxist tradition that can help us understand the nature and role of law in contemporary capitalism. In this course, we will explore how movements for fundamental social change can effectively engage with Marxist legal theories. What does Marx's famous phrase 'Between equal rights, force decides' really mean? What is the nature of the relationship between the coercive power of law and class struggle? How can Marxist thought help to demystify legal mainstays like property and contract rights, labor relations, and state police powers? How have Marxism-inspired liberation and resistance movements situated themselves in relation to law over time? In addition to Marx's own writings, we will draw from the works of important Marxist political theorists like Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser and key Marxist legal scholars like Evgeny Pashukanis, Karl Renner, Alan Hunt, China Mieville, Brenna Bhandar, and Aziz Rana, as well as the Critical Legal Studies movement, Critical Race Theory, and the emergent Law and Political Economy movement.

Through literature, film, and scholarship, we will trace how works of cultural production have imagined debt, mapping how relations of indebtedness manifest themselves in figurative and affective registers as much as economic oneshow, in other words, does the imperative to repay debt rely on the cultural meaning ascribed to feeling indebted? At the same time, we will engage with a variety of legal sourcesincluding case law, statutes and regulations, administrative law guidance, and legal scholarshipto determine how this figurative economy influences the law and political economy of debt. Tracing the co-constitution of laws and cultural production through close attention to debt represents our primary task. Topics we will consider include the constitutional relationship between debt and money in the United States; administrative law challenges to student loan forgiveness programs; laws governing corporate bankruptcy procedures; and challenges to existing frameworks of sovereign debt in the international community. For each, we will discuss literature and films that illuminate how legal structures materialize debts fictions. Students will develop their own research projects related to debt, though these do not have to be in line with the topics listed above.

    "description": "Knots appear throughout history and in many aspects of our lives. In ancient times, multiple civilizations used them to record data such as in Andean South America and East Asia while in other parts of the world like Northeast Africa and Southwest Asia, knots were more often used in spiritual and religious applications. Knots have other real-world applications even now, such as in sailing, rock climbing, protein folding, and string theory! These days, knot theory is a rich and active area of research involving questions of interest both to mathematicians and to researchers outside of mathematics, and many of these questions boil down to a single essential query: how can we tell when two knots are different? In this course we will begin the study of mathematical knots starting with this question. In order to answer it, we will construct tools called knot invariants and use them to investigate when knots can and cannot be distinguished from each other. Along the way, we will get a taste of some introductory topics in topology, combinatorics, algebra, and analysis including colorings, polynomials, surfaces, and graphs. At the end of the course, there will be a final project which can include interdisciplinary work. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: problem sets, in-class quizzes or exams, take-home exams, reading and writing of mathematical proofs, use of computational software, final project with writing and oral presentation component.",

It then evolves toward the rigorous study of discrete and continuous probability spaces, independence, conditional probability, expectation, and variance.

    "description": "Whether its a rapper lyrically flowing over a looped breakbeat or a Bach fugues imitative melodic lines helping determine the pieces structure, most of the music we interact with on a daily basis involves the careful interplay of two or more musical elements. Putting musical lines in conversation creates grooves, harmonies, and complex timbral sonorities. But how do musicians and listeners make sense of the relationship between simultaneously sounding musical ideas? In this class, we study how simultaneously sounding musical ideas interact, by examining the ideas of counterpoint and harmony within four distinct musical traditions. We begin by exploring species counterpoint, a European pedagogical compositional technique popularized in the 18th century by Austrian composer Johann Joseph Fux. From there, we analyze ideas of counterpoint in hip hop from the United States, looking at the relationship between flow, beats, and rhyme schemes. Then, we engage with the harmonic language of two tonal music traditions: Western art music of the 18th and 19th centuries, and American popular music of the last 60 years. Through composition, analysis, dictation and performance, we will develop theoretical and practical tools to cultivate a deep understanding of the conventions of counterpoint and harmony across these styles. This course is the first of the required music theory sequence for majors. Three class meetings and two ear-training sections per week. Students are also encouraged to discuss placement in music theory with a member of the Music Department. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: artistic work, aural analysis, readings, written work, oral presentations, and group work.",

How can we explore these worlds and understand the technical means with which they were created?

Through close reading of nineteenth-century music by Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Liszt, and Brahms, we will explore the possibilities of musical expression and meaning, searching for parallels between poetic and musical interpretation. Works will be considered from a number of different analytical perspectives including methods current in the nineteenth century and those developed more recently.

While psychologists have traditionally focused on how humans think, feel, and behave, neuroscientists have primarily focused exclusively on the workings of the brain. Cognitive neuroscience is a relatively new discipline that lies at the intersection of these fields and seeks to understand the neurobiological processes that underlie cognition. This course serves as a broad introduction to the field of cognitive neuroscience and will focus on a variety of questions, including the following: How does the brain obtain and process information about the environment via sight, taste, and touch? How does the brain support our capacity to learn and speak different languages? What happens to the brain when it is afflicted with neurological disorders such as Alzheimers, amnesia, schizophrenia, and autism? This course will provide students with a foundational understanding of modern cognitive neuroscience and the ways in which researchers examine the relationship between the mind and the brain. Attention to writing, science and math for non-majors.",

To explore this question, the lecture portion of the course will address the foundational neuroendocrinological pathways such as the sex steroids, nonapeptides, and corticosteroids. We will read and discuss primary literature articles on how these pathways shape social behavior across domains including mate choice, reproduction, parenting, aggression, and stress. Importantly, these papers will highlight a variety of animal models in order to explore the immense diversity of mating systems, sexual determination systems, and social community and hierarchy structures seen across the animal kingdom. The laboratory component of the course will apply both the behavioral and the neuromolecular concepts discussed in the lecture portion of the class through hands-on experiments in which students observe animal behavior and then process brain tissue to label and image proteins of interest. At the end of the semester, students will present their lab findings in a class symposium. Three classroom lecture hours. Three hours of laboratory work per week plus one scheduled optional hour of laboratory preparation assistance. How to handle overenrollment: Priority will first be given to biology and neuroscience seniors who require the course to graduate and then to junior biology and neuroscience and then by class year or instructor consent.

The obesity epidemic of the last several decades continues to spread across the globe, leading to a rise in metabolic diseases and more pressing need than ever to understand the neurobiological controls of eating and body weight. Through a broad survey of neurobiological research literature, we will explore how various neurobiological systems and behavioral processes influence eating and body weight, including metabolism, neural mechanisms of hunger and satiety, metabolic disorders, dieting, pica, failure to thrive, starvation, taste preference and aversion, obesity, anxiety and depression, food taboos, and all eating disorders. Strong emphasis will be placed on biological mechanisms and controlled laboratory research with both human and animal subjects.

    "description": "A man named Socrates lived in Athens, Greece, during the 5th century BCE. He was tried on grounds of impiety and corruption of the young, found guilty by a jury of approximately 500 of his fellow Athenians, and executed. During his life, Socrates was also engaged in a practice that was later dubbed philosophy. His importance in determining the scope and methods of the discipline is indicated by the fact that Greek philosophers who preceded him are typically referred to as Presocratic. But, as a philosopher, it is not entirely clear what Socrates believed. He never wrote down any of his views. In fact, Socrates is famous for denying that he had any wisdom of any significance. And yet, despite this apparent humility, later philosophers (Plato and Aristotle) and a contemporary playwright (Aristophanes) and historian (Xenophon) represent him as holding very definite views, supported by arguments, about how to live our best lives. Unfortunately, their reports are not consistent. In this course, we will be concerned to answer two questions: (1) What sort of evidence is relevant to determining the views of a philosopher who lived over two millennia ago? (2) What should we make of the views and arguments of this philosopher? In addition to the writing in translation that we can access from Amherst, MA, we will have the opportunity to learn more about Socrates by traveling to Athens, Greece over spring break to retrace Socrates own footsteps, learn from local Athenian historians, and explore carefully curated museum exhibits on Ancient Greek culture and society. This course has no prerequisites, though one must apply to be admitted to the course.

For example, we might say that you are responsible for your misdeeds because you could have chosen otherwise; you chose to act as you did. What is the analog to this way of explaining responsibility when it comes to our mental lives? In what sense could we have believed otherwise? And in what sense ought we to know certain things? Some epistemologistsphilosophers who study knowledge and beliefhave argued that epistemic agency is an empty concept. Belief, as they say, aims at the truth. The idea is that I do not choose to believe that Milo is the best dog because I prefer to believe it, or because I have decided that the evidence is in his favor (it is!). Instead, I believe it because its truth compels me: it is evident, and in virtue of recognizing the evidence for what it is, the belief arises in me unbidden. Your beliefs smack you in the face; they happen to you, not because of you. But what, then, do we make of our widespreadand, arguably, deeply meaningfulpractice of evaluating one another on the basis of our beliefs? Why do we admire one another for our good ideas, or repudiate one another for reactionary, dogmatic, or bigoted beliefs? If these practices of evaluationwhich seem to presuppose that we are responsible for our beliefsare legitimate, why are they? In what sense are our beliefs under our control? Are we free to know, and believe?

    "description": "The basic laws of physics governing the behavior of microscopic particles are in certain respects simple. They give rise both to complex behavior of macroscopic aggregates of these particles, and more remarkably, to a new kind of simplicity. Thermodynamics focuses on the simplicity at the macroscopic level directly, and formulates its laws in terms of a few observable parameters like temperature and pressure. Statistical Mechanics, on the other hand, seeks to build a bridge between mechanics and thermodynamics, providing in the process, a basis for the latter, and pointing out the limits to its range of applicability. Statistical Mechanics also allows one to investigate, in principle, physical systems outside the range of validity of Thermodynamics. After an introduction to thermodynamic laws, we will consider a microscopic view of entropy, formulate the kinetic theory, and study several pertinent probability distributions including the classical Boltzmann distribution. Relying on a quantum picture of microscopic laws, we will study photon and phonon gases, chemical potential, classical and degenerate quantum ideal gases, and chemical and phase equilibria.

In the second part of the course, students will be exposed to a range of biographical and first person accounts, both historical and modern, of the scientific careers and discoveries of various physicists, astrophysicists, and biophysicists. We will explore the challenges that these scientists encountered within a range of contexts and cultures, and the effect that their identities and discoveries had on society and the practice of science more broadly.

    "description": "This course provides an introduction to the field of International Relations (IR). It examines key debates in IR, such as the origins and consequences of wars, the influence of organizations like the UN, the IMF, and the WHO, and international cooperation on global challenges like climate change. Students will evaluate the evidence supporting these debates. They will do so by focusing on the political origins of data and how such origins shape critical patterns in the data. They will research and compare existing datasets provided by international institutions and others collected by academic laboratories.

Focusing on the philosophical, social, legal, institutional, cultural, and economic lenses through which Americans have made sense of the role of firearms in American politics, this course will use firearms policy to explore a range of questions: how has our understanding of self-protection changed or not over time? What was the role of the Second Amendment in the making of the Constitution? How do we make sense of the controversies and debates that have surrounded the right to bear arms and its interpretation in legal and historical scholarship? How does mobilization around guns and gun rights reflect and shape racial, ethnic, and gender identities? Where and when do such mobilizations occur? In what ways are U.S. policies and attitudes actually exceptional among developed countries? In this sense, guns serve as a way of putting into sharp focus deeper questions about the institutional and social contexts of belonging and exclusion in U.S. politics.",

We will cover international institutions, international trade, international finance, economic development, and the domestic implications of globalization for different states and place a particular emphasis on contemporary geopolitical stress points, such as the war in Ukraine, trade disputes, refugee issues, and the pursuit of sustainability goals in the global green transition. After focusing on theoretical assessments and methodological approaches, we will apply these economic theories to various subjects (states, institutions, corporations) and processes (the flow of capital, goods, and people, integration, globalization), and end with current issues and debates surrounding the \"globalization backlash,\" examining the political, economic, and social dimensions of globalization.",

In a 2019 interview, philosopher and eco-feminist Donna Haraway observed that the established disorder of our present era is not necessary. Are there ways to imagine the world without this disorder? What encounters between place-based lives and climate change are necessary? How can we speak truth to power in a post-truth era? We will explore these and other questions as truth games, each with particular political and aesthetic impacts. As cultural anthropologist Paul Rabinow put it, to establish the right relationship to the presentto things, to others, to oneselfone must stay close to events, experience them, be willing to be effected and affected by them. Through close reading and discussion, we will explore what can further environmental and social justice, as well as what has aggravated climate change. We will explore ways to inhabit (not dominate) the Earth, ways to embrace (not fear) social and cultural diversity, ways to renew (not extract) resources, and ways to work together (not against one another) for the common good. Readings will include the voices of artists, critics, historians, cultural theorists, anthropologists, and philosophers, including Sara Ahmed, Kate Crawford, Michel Foucault, NK Jemison, Donna Haraway, Jack Halberston, Bruno Latour, Ursula Le Guin, Paul Rabinow, and Kim Stanley Robinson.

Across the historical periods covered in the course, particular attention will be devoted to explaining variation in the forms of Zionism and Palestinian nationalism that have emerged and how their respective national projects were driven by internal competition among factions with different organizations, objectives, and strategies. The first part of the course will focus on the entangled emergence of the Zionist and Palestinian national movements in the late Ottoman period and under the British Mandate. The second will focus on 1948 through 1967, including the Israeli founding and early state building, the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem, the formation of the PLO, and how these events impacted the broader Middle East. The third part will examine the aftermath of the 1967 war through the Oslo Peace Process in the 1990s, and the final part of the course will look at the \"post-Oslo\" period through the present day. Students will read a wide variety of primary and secondary sources, with attention devoted to patterns of narrative construction and revision, shifts in historiographic trends, and critical engagement with prominent lines of argumentation related to Israeli and Palestinian politics.

    "description": "What is the European Union? How and why did it start? Where is it headed? Will it become stronger and grow into a full-fledged United States of Europe? Will it become weaker and join the ranks of typical international organizations, following the various crises it has confronted on several dimensions: economic, migration, political - in particular, concerning its impact on sovereignty, democracy, identity, and legitimacy? The EU has evolved from its original ambitions as an economic regional integration project towards a geo-political entity, becoming a multi-level governance structure with its own constitution, currency, court, and form of citizenship, with powerful institutions, increasingly porous internal borders and a common external border. The experiment succeeded to such an extent that countries in other parts of the world have been considering ways to emulate the EU model and adapt it to their region. Some have argued that the EU is sui generis, an unprecedented supranational structure that should be studied as such (some have referred to it as an unidentified political object). Others have relied on scholarship on international organizations and comparative federalism to include it on a continuum ranging from international organizations to confederations and federal states. Yet others have turned to the distant past to find equivalents, arguing that the EU resembles a neo-medieval empire (Zielonka). This course tackles the big questions concerning the EUs past, present, and future, and discusses their ramifications for European and world politics. How far and deep can the EU project expand? Is the EU sufficiently democratic? Does it represent member-states' and citizens' interests effectively? How should it be reformed? Will European integration benefit or suffer after Brexit? Can the EU withstand the pressures of global economic competition and the rise of new economic giants like China? Can it find solutions to the migration crisis without compromising its defining features: porous internal borders and freedom of movement for goods, capital, services, and people on its territory? Will it overcome internal divisions between East and West, between new members and the old core of advanced industrialized democracies? This course introduces students to the concepts, theories, and empirical resources needed to examine European integration and enlargement. We will survey the history and development of the European integration project to understand its institutional framework and relationship with member-states in different policy areas. We will assess the major theories of EU integration in light of current events. We will delve into specific EU policy areas (economic and monetary union, security, migration, external relations, etc.) to understand how the EU shapes the lives of its citizens. We will also study the EUs relationship with the United States, the United Kingdom, and the rounds of enlargement towards Southern and post-communist Central and Eastern Europe, which have all played an essential role in shaping what the EU is today.

The terrorist trend continued into the twentieth century; in 1918, the Socialist Revolutionary Party attempted to assassinate Lenin. Eradicated by Stalin, terrorism resurfaced in the 1990s, when Russia found itself under attack by Chechen separatists. Legitimacy of political terrorism as the last refuge of the oppressed has been actively debated in Russia for more than a century, and the fact that terrorist groups in question ranged from proto-Marxists to the pseudo-Islamic has made Russian discourse on terrorism uncommonly rich. We will be using a variety of primary sources, such as terrorists manifestos and memoirs, as well as conceptual critiques of terror, starting with Dostoyevskys novel Demons. First, we will wrestle with the definition of terrorism as opposed to terror. Second, we will explore the place of terrorism in a revolutionary movement and war. Third, we will look at the counter-terrorism measures applied by the Russian government in the past and now. A case study of terrorism in Russia will hopefully help us to answer a number of questions that are highly relevant today.

This course will analyze todays Great Power relations and review the explanatory value of this Cold War analogy. We will begin by studying the major IR theories (realist, liberal, and Marxist) which explain todays relations among the US, China and Russia and then compare them to the major features of the original Cold War system which characterized Great Power relations during most of the second half of the twentieth century to determine if both are sufficiently similar to be referred to as Cold Wars. To facilitate this endeavor, we will divide the Cold War system of the post-World War II era into several historical periods so that we can better understand which of them were the most, and which the least, perilous and also whether any of these periods resemble the current times in which we live. This may help us recognize what needs to be done so that the Great Powers can either avoid a 'New Cold War' altogether or at least escape its dangerous extremes.

Devoting equal parts of the term to each author, we will dwell in, and move between, very different political problematics: the cultural production of woman; the psychic effects of racialized colonial rule; the perpetuation of capitalism through the sowing of false needs; the consecration of sex as identity. Yet we will also keep an eye on certain broad questions and themes. These include the production of the human subject by power; the ruses by which contingent social orders such as capitalism or colonialism come to appear as natural, total, or timeless; and the difference between surface and radical freedom. Readings will be drawn from: The Second Sex (Beauvoir); Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth (Fanon); Eros and Civilization and One-Dimensional Man (Marcuse); and Discipline and Punish or The History of Sexuality, Volume One (Foucault).",

Whom a society punishes and how it punishes are key political questions as well as indicators of a state's character. The character of punishment in the United States has been shaped, throughout American history, by race and racism. This course considers the connections between punishment, race, and politics in this country. We will ask how far we have come in the journey from lynch mobs to the killing state. We also will consider whether we punish too much and too severely, or too little and too leniently, and the ways race has shaped the ways we punish. We will examine the politicization and racialization of punishment and examine particular modalities through which the state dispenses its penal power. Among the questions to be discussed are: Does punishment express our noblest aspirations for justice or our basest racialized fears and desires for vengeance? Can punishment ever be an adequate expression of, or response to, the pain of the victims of crime? When is it appropriate to forgive rather than punish? How do race and racial antagonism shape the answer to that question? Throughout we will try to understand the meaning of punishment in the United States by its intimate connections to this country's racial history.",

    "description": "By exposing structures of domination and coercion and undermining the beliefs and values which sustain them, Marxists seek to pave the way towards radical social transformation. Tensions arise between revolutionary politics and the rule of law; liberals revere and authoritarians impose. The Marxist critique of capitalism necessarily involves inquiry into law, since legal relations are mutually constitutive with other social relations and law is a crucial component in the totality of capitalist social relations. While Karl Marx never produced a comprehensive theory of law, state, and rights, there is much in his work and in the broader Marxist tradition that can help us understand the nature and role of law in contemporary capitalism. In this course, we will explore how movements for fundamental social change can effectively engage with Marxist legal theories. What does Marxs famous phrase Between equal rights, force decides really mean? What is the nature of the relationship between the coercive power of law and class struggle? How can Marxist thought help to demystify legal mainstays like property and contract rights, labor relations, and state police powers? How have Marxism-inspired liberation and resistance movements situated themselves in relation to law over time? In addition to Marxs own writings, we will draw from the works of important Marxist political theorists like Antonio Gramsci, Louis Althusser and key Marxist legal scholars like Evgeny Pashukanis, Karl Renner, Alan Hunt, China Mieville, Brenna Bhandar, Aziz Rana, and, as well as the Critical Legal Studies movement, Critical Race Theory, and the emergent Law and Political Economy movement.

How have they impacted politics across the region? This seminar will study the civil wars in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. For each case, we will assess competing explanations for the sources, trajectory, and resolution of the war (historical or prospective). We will use our empirical inquiry to consider broader conceptual and theoretical questions about civil wars that hold relevance beyond the region. What features make civil wars a distinctive type of conflict? How should they be differentiated from other types of conflict, like protracted insurgency or rebellions? How do civil wars break out and how do they end? What are the affects of foreign intervention? What forms do peace agreements commonly take, and through what processes do they emerge? Students will write a final research paper in which they dive deeper into analysis of a case from the course, a new case, or a comparative study. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on close, critical reading of social scientific and historical writing, intensive discussions, small group projects, and written work.",

How do they interact? We know that policies can be based on scientific research, and that scientific priorities can be shaped by political motives. But does scientific research ever resemble politics? Can politics affect, not just scientific objectives, but the very content of knowledge or truth? We will explore these questions by studying two major theorists of science and politics: Michel Foucault and Bruno Latour. We will read both their philosophical and empirical work. One aim of the course is to build a vocabulary for discussing the many and complex relations between science and politics. A second aim is to ground this vocabulary in concrete examples. Studying Foucaults histories of psychiatry, medical science, and criminology and Latours ethnographies of biological research and engineering will enable us to do both. Course texts include: Madness and Civilization , The Birth of the Clinic , Discipline and Punish (Foucault); and Science in Action, Politics of Nature, Down to Earth (Latour).

In what ways has Europe shaped the meaning of democratic politics, and our expectations about the relationship between state, society, and the market in a democratic polity? Is there anything the United States can learn from European experiences with democratic politics? This seminar examines the dimensions of European democracy, at the national and at the supranational (European Union) level. It tracks the evolution of democracy from its beginnings until the present. We will discuss visions and varieties of democracy, past and present, the different timelines for democratic development, transitions to democracy in Central and Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War, and the impact of European integration. We will compare and contrast consolidated and fledgling democracies on the continent, and discuss similarities and differences between European and American understandings of democracy. We will analyze the relationship between majority rule and minority rights, the frictions between representation and direct participation, the relationship between democracy and nationalism, the tensions between European integration and democratization, the uneasy coexistence of democracy and capitalism, as well as the decisions facing those writing constitutions for countries transitioning to democracy after years of authoritarian rule. We will analyze current events and challenges testing the resilience of European democracies, old and new.

It is structured around two moments in history: (i) the emergence of early arguments for gay liberation in Britain between 1880 and 1930; and (ii) the renewed debates about the democratic possibilities and limitations of queer theory in the past three decades. The historical focus is on Britain because an intellectually rich gay liberation movement emerges there while Britain was at the forefront of debates about representative democracy. From these two vantage points, we will examine several persistent and important questions about sexuality and democracy. Do sexual minorities have anything distinctive to say about democracy? Is resistance to sexual oppression best conducted via traditional democratic institutions, or through radical transformations of everyday life and other extra-institutional means? Is a democratic queer politics possible independent of other marginalized groups, or can it only be realized as part of a broader coalition of oppressed groups? Must queer democratic theory reject normativity, or can it articulate a positive theory of value? These questions are open and debatable, and this course is an attempt to explore them so that students are prepared to enter the long-running debates about them. Students are not expected to come to this course with answers already prepared.

Initially, we will discuss how our eyes, ears, and brain turn light and sound into colors, objects, speech, and music. Next, we will look at how memory is organized and how it is used to accomplish a variety of tasks. Several memory models will be proposed and evaluated: Is our brain a large filing cabinet? A sophisticated computer? We will then apply these principles to understand issues like intelligence, thinking, and problem-solving. Throughout the course, we will discuss how damage to various parts of the brain affects our ability to learn and remember. Students will complete two 5-7 page papers and a peer review of another students paper. Three in-class exams are normally assigned. There are also short simulations of classic experiments (usually one or two per week) that students will be asked to complete using an online program.",

We will discuss individual differences (gender and age) in autobiographical memory and will also examine the neurobiology of long-term memory and the consequences of damage to the system (i.e., dementia and amnesia). Finally, we will explore how social groups retain memories for important cultural events. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: This course will involve weekly readings of a handful of journal articles and a short weekly written response to the reading assignments.

We will study the Qurans literary qualities, including style, structure, unity, and eloquence, and we will study the Qurans protagonists, including the Biblical and Arabian prophets, and its narratives and themes. Further, we will try to understand the ways that the Quran violates rules of unity, harmony, and try to make sense of its abrupt changes of subject matter, interruptions or lack of continuities, and miscellaneous fragments by finding unity, coherence, and intelligibility in them. The inevitable question of how the Quran engages with the Biblical narratives and themes and how such pre-existent materials can help us interpret the Quran are just two of our areas of inquiry, but there are others too: Is the Quran prose or poetry? How can our analysis of the Quran as literature help us understand its religious meaning and message, including its conception of history, and its ideas of transcendent esoteric wisdom? The course covers the full trajectory of literary approaches to the Quran from roughly the ninth century until the present. We will begin by comparing the Quran to the most eloquent poetry of Ancient Arabia and end by analyzing the works of contemporary women interpreters of the Quran.

How have they encountered differences with other religions? How did the notion of a universal history develop in Islam? How did Muslims conceive of the place of human beings in the cosmic order? What kind of global awareness did they have? To explore these issues and examine how Muslims describe the Other, we will study maps, universal histories, encyclopedies of world religions, doxographies and heresiographies, and travelogues. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: an emphasis on written work, close reading; attention to writing and speaking.",

    "description": "Dreams and visions play a variety of roles in religion: they are a mode of divine communication; they reveal the future, the past, and the esoteric; they are spaces of encounter with deities, angels, demons, and other non- or trans-human entities. This course approaches dreaming and states of altered consciousness from the perspective of the academic study of religion in conversation with theories from other disciplines, including anthropology, sociology, and psychology. Our work will focus largely on understandings of dreams and visions in predominately Christian cultures from antiquity to the present, although students are welcome to explore other geographical and cultural contexts in their papers and discussions. Special attention will be given to developing critical writing. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Close reading and analysis of primary texts and previous scholarship; visual analysis; independent research; group work; active participation in seminar discussion; oral presentations; informal in-class writing; formal written papers and revision.",

    "description": "Play is an essential component of human life. Yet, while the word play evokes leisure and frivolity, it can be serious work. Cultural values, spiritual truths, and social politics arise from play, particularly when they are codified in sports. From raucous games of lacrosse in pre-Columbian North America to Tim Tebows gameday prayers, sports have long been used as instruments of social cohesion and as a way to connect a people to their gods. This course will examine the close relationship between religion and sport in modern American history and will push students beyond the sports-as-religion paradigm to consider sport as a medium of exchange between the overlapping influences of celebrity, national politics, religion, and the economy. We will cover how sports and religion intersect with topics like nationalism, gender, race, sexuality, identity formation, commercialism, mass-media, recreation, and labor. Concepts like ritual, collective effervescence, and sacred space will be used to analyze key historical movements and organizations, such as muscular Christianity, the YMCA, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, the Olympics, amateurism and the NCAA, and Black Lives Matter. Key figures for examining sport as a site of piety and protest include Muhammad Ali, Serena Williams, Tim Tebow, Jackie Robinson, Colin Kaepernick, and Abe Saperstein. Throughout the course we will ask: How, where, and when do sports act religiously? What do sports and religion accomplish together that they cannot accomplish alone? Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on written work, development of research skills, final research paper, short essays, oral presentations, emphasis on reading and group discussion, group work and peer-review, in-class visitors and possible off-campus site visits.",

The course examines key issues that have shaped the development of modern Buddhism across East Asia, while fostering a critical assessment of some fundamental assumptions in the making of the modern age. Threading through the entire course is a provocative dialogue between, on the one hand, modern events and intellectual currents such as scientific rationalism, secularization, imperialism, nationalism, feminism, and environmentalism, and on the other hand, seminal Buddhist teachings that stand profoundly persuasive across time and space. We unpack this dialogue through stories, which are drawn from China, Japan, Taiwan, Tibet, Vietnam, and from Europe and America. The seminar highlights literature as a vehicle for spiritual reflection especially in a global and postsecular world. All readings are in English. No prior knowledge of Buddhism is assumed. Requirements include weekly reflection papers, an oral presentation, and a final paper. Two class meetings per week. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: an emphasis on written work, readings, independent research, oral presentations, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, visual analysis.",

This course examines key works from the queer tradition within Russian literature, focusing both on works that are explicit about their sexual or gender thematics and on works that are perhaps less straightforward in their representations of queerness. This course will survey some works by Mikhail Kuzmin, Marina Tsvetaeva, Slava Mogutin, Dmitry Kuzmin, Oksana Vasiakina, and others. No knowledge of Russian or Russian literature is needed for this course. All works will be read in English translation, with additional optional sessions for students wishing to read all or some of the texts in the original Russian.

As Eisenstein postulated in 1939, \"the method of cinema, when fully comprehended, will enable us to reveal an understanding of the method of art in general.\" In our effort to comprehend his work and enduring relevance, we will consider Eisenstein's stylistics through attentive viewing of his key films: Strike, Battleship Potemkin, October, Old and New, the never completed Que viva Mexico !, Alexander Nevsky, and Ivan the Terrible. Along with examining their formal features and rich historical and ideological contexts, we will also consider Eisenstein's theoretical texts on cinema and culture, attending in particular to his theories of montage, method, and his writings on the histories of literature and art.

    "description": "Since its invention in Athens, tragic drama has focused upward on the great or mighty as they fall but also outward on the disempowered as they are for once given public voice: women, slaves, and barbarians. The cosmic forces of fate and the gods play out along social fault lines with conflicting viewpoints. We look to a hero, but, changing his mask, a Greek actor could go from god to wife to peasant. This multiplicity complicates itself in modern stagings and films as they cast actors with specific gender and racial identities. Female actors now have indisputable claim on the once-male roles of Antigone, Cassandra, Medea, and Electra, as they do on Shakespeares Cleopatra. The dialects of tragic performance are multiple: translationese, Shakespeare, and Spanglish. In this course we start with the formation of Hellenic identity and notions of heroism in Homer's Iliad and then look at the performance of plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Shakespeare in their historical context, as well as at adaptations in film and dance. We also consider remakings of the myths within modern realities, including Antigone in Ferguson; Rita Doves The Darker Face of the Earth (Oedipus); and Luis Alfaros Mojada (Medea), Electricidad (Electra), and Oedipus El Rey. For the bodies of comedy, well look at Spike Lees recasting of Aristophanes Lysistrata in Chi Raq. The course aims to give students independent command of influential plays, as well as insight into the aesthetics and politics of putting contemporary bodies into classic roles. We consider and apply core concepts relating to the representation of gender, race, and sexuality. The requirements are regular attendance and participation, brief before-class responses, and four essays.",

We will explore the ways in which feminism is multi-vocal, non-linear, and influenced by multiple and shifting sites of feminist identities. This exploration includes the examination and analysis of local and global feminist thoughts on gender/sex, race, sexuality, disability, reproductive justice, colonialism, nationalism as they effect and shape social and economic forms of power and oppression.

    "description": "Whence comes my help? From where does your strength come? The psalmist and Adrienne Rich ask these questions, which we will face while we read coming-of-age narratives that fit in a genre known by its German name, the Bildungsroman. These novels go beyond the pilgrimage out of adolescence, and into explicit representation of intellectual, aesthetic, and spiritual growth experienced in unison with sexual development, awakenings, thrills, mishaps, and marriage. We will pay attention to how we immerse ourselves into the condition of those who grow on the page; not to identify with the characters, but to accompany them. From our immersive accompaniment we will re-emerge intentionally to write about how we progress, digress, regress, and grow some more. As we read we will explore many terms and theoretical concerns: Erik Erickson on life stages; Donald Winnicott on holding environment and object relation; Jacques Lacan on mirrors and interminability of desire; Silvan Tomkins on affects and nuclear scripts; Shoshana Feldman on re-reading, un-learning, en-gendering, and again desire. Readings will likely include: Roland Barthes, A Lovers Discourse; Jeffrey Eugenides, The Marriage Plot; Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre; Ayad Akhtar, American Dervish; James Baldwin, Go Tell It on the Mountain; Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God; Richard Powers, The Overstory; The Lift of Rocks Uphill: Epistolary coming of Age Short Stories. The coursework includes four short pieces of writing and a substantial Capstone Project.

    "description": "This course explores the life and writings of American author James Baldwin. Born in poverty-stricken Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance (where he spent his childhood as a Pentecostal boy-preacher), Baldwin went on to become one of the twentieth centurys most influential essayists, novelists, orators, and political commentators---particularly around issues related to American race relations. Unapologetically black, queer, and radicalBaldwins writings have become a source of resurgent public interest, particularly in the wake of todays turbulent U.S. political climate. In this course we will study key moments in Baldwins oeuvre and situate the authors work in a variety of relevant historical contexts (such as in the contexts of the American civil rights movement; the black power movement; the gay liberation movement, and the contemporary movement for black lives). We will pay particular attention to reoccurring themes that sit at the center of Baldwins political philosophy including: the power of love as an animating force for social transformation; the resilient nature of black resistance; the role and responsibility of artists- as-troublemakers; the limitations of white ally-ship, the dangers (and creative possibilities) of organized religion; and the ongoing problem of global white supremacy. In addition, we will place Baldwins writings in conversation with the voices of some of his contemporaries and literary progeny. One primary concern will be how to place Baldwins writings in conversation with current debates about race, gender, sexuality, and politics in contemporary America. Why does Baldwins work seem to resonate so forcefully with the social justice concerns of today and to what ends? Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on written work including weekly journal entries, readings, oral presentations, active in-class verbal participation, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, field work or trips, visual analysis, aural analysis, dramaturgical analysis, performance analysis.",

    "description": "This course examines the relationship between movements for sexual liberation and theories of democracy. It is structured around two moments in history: (i) the emergence of early arguments for gay liberation in Britain between 1880 and 1930; and (ii) the renewed debates about the democratic possibilities and limitations of queer theory in the past three decades. The historical focus is on Britain because an intellectually rich gay liberation movement emerges there while Britain was at the forefront of debates about representative democracy. From these two vantage points, we will examine several persistent and important questions about sexuality and democracy. Do sexual minorities have anything distinctive to say about democracy? Is resistance to sexual oppression best conducted via traditional democratic institutions, or through radical transformations of everyday life and other extra-institutional means? Is a democratic queer politics possible independent of other marginalized groups, or can it only be realized as part of a broader coalition of oppressed groups? Must queer democratic theory reject normativity, or can it articulate a positive theory of value? These questions are open and debatable, and this course is an attempt to explore them so that students are prepared to enter the long-running debates about them. Students are not expected to come to this course with answers already prepared. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on written work and reading, as well as a creative assignment based on the course's focus on reading texts creatively as political theory.",

The course develops students ability to interact in culturally appropriate ways with native speakers of Spanish, negotiate situations that require problem solving, and exchange detailed descriptions, comparisons, and interpretations about authentic materials from the Spanish-speaking world. The course will use authentic texts from a variety of media, including film, literature, visual arts, music, and web-based texts. The course includes an online conversation partner program so students can practice their language skills with Spanish speakers around the world. By the end of the semester, students can expect to have reached the Advanced Low level of the ACTFL scale, and be ready to proceed to SPAN 301 (Introduction to Literary and Cultural Studies), or to an immersive study abroad experience in any of Amherst Colleges pre-approved programs in the Spanish-speaking world. The course consists of two 80-minute sessions per week with the lecturer and one 50-minute session with the language assistant. This course may be counted toward the Spanish Major. The class will be conducted entirely in Spanish. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Oral presentations, written essays, in-class quizzes or exams, online conversations with native speakers, group work and projects, instruction in Spanish, emphasis on writing, reading, speaking, and listening in Spanish.",

    "description": "Heritage learners of Spanish are students who have grown up speaking, listening, reading and/or writing Spanish with family or in their community. Because of their unique backgrounds, Spanish heritage language learners (SHLLs) are bilingual and bicultural. They function between a Hispanic and an American identity. This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups. With this in mind, through meaningful activities that focus on students experiences and emotions, this Spanish language course will center on bilingualism, specifically through writing, as a necessary means for identity formation. Because in narrating our stories with others, we enact our identities, this course will include an event open to the community that showcases our voices and talents. Through this course, students will incorporate their personal experience as SHLLs into their coursework. Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity. Using a student-centered approach, the course will include collaborative brainstorming, free-writing, developing topics of personal importance, and peer and group editing in order to develop students writing proficiency and to build community. This course prepares Spanish heritage language students for advanced-level courses offered by the Spanish Department. This course may be counted toward the Spanish Major. The class will be conducted entirely in Spanish, though some assignments can be submitted in English. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: an emphasis on written work, readings, oral presentations, independent research, group work, instruction in languages other than English, visual and aural analysis.",

It explores how communities form beyond traditional places of belonging and national allegiances. We will investigate the distinctions between building community and practicing radical hospitality, examine spaces that welcome these initiatives, and explore practices that give rise to history, memory, and (re)telling for these communities. The class will address these questions practically and theoretically, focusing on the Caribbean and Latin American diaspora in the USA, including the experiences of the students themselves. Local partnerships will play a key role: 1. Book & Plow: Students will participate in the initial stages of the 'Seeds of the Diaspora' project, a community garden featuring seeds brought by migrants throughout their journeys. 2. Mead Museum: The class will engage with Michael Rakowitz's exhibit 'Part of an Impossible Task.' Students will work closely with these community partners, combining hands-on components with research assignments and written reflections. The curriculum will also include readings and assignments on hospitality, migration, refuge, gardening as an artistic and political practice, monuments, and memorials. Emphasis on independent research and community-based artistic practices.",

How can we interact playfully with movement, text, space, and time? How do the design elements of performance (such as light, sound, objects, etc.) play with each other? Study of performance conventions and forms, seminal performance works, and theoretical readings will provide context for experiential learning. Through the creation of short pieces, students will learn to embrace the role of improvisation in various rehearsal situations and creative discussions, and increase their sensory awareness and responsiveness to others, while distinguishing among modes of thought and action. Regular journaling and writing will be required. In addition, visits to in-progress rehearsals and performances outside of class will also be included.

Through the modulation of muscle tone, rolling, sliding, and counterbalance, students learn to give and support weight, creating spontaneous compositions.

How did folklore and myth develop into various forms of rationality: science, history, and philosophy? What are the implications of male control over public and private life and the written record? What can be inferred about ancient women if they cannot speak for themselves in the texts? How does slavery work in a culture when it is based on capture rather than racial difference? What do we hear when people in bondage are given voice in epic and drama? Other authors include Sappho, Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, and Thucydides.

    "description": "Whence comes my help? From where does your strength come? The psalmist and Adrienne Rich ask these questions, which we will face while we read coming-of-age narratives that fit in a genre known by its German name, the Bildungsroman. These novels go beyond the pilgrimage out of adolescence, and into explicit representation of intellectual, aesthetic, and spiritual growth experienced in unison with sexual development, awakenings, thrills, mishaps, and marriage. We will pay attention to how we immerse ourselves into the condition of those who grow on the page; not to identify with the characters, but to accompany them. From our immersive accompaniment we will re-emerge intentionally to write about how we progress, digress, regress, and grow some more. As we read we will explore many terms and theoretical concerns: Erik Erickson on life stages; Donald Winnicott on holding environment and object relation; Jacques Lacan on mirrors and interminability of desire; Silvan Tomkins on affects and nuclear scripts; Shoshana Feldman on re-reading, un-learning, en-gendering, and again desire. Readings will likely include: Roland Barthes, A Lovers Discourse; Jeffrey Eugenides, The Marriage Plot; Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre; Ayad Akhtar, American Dervish; James Baldwin, Go Tell It on the Mountain; Zora Neale Hurston, Their Eyes Were Watching God; Richard Powers, The Overstory; The Lift of Rocks Uphill: Epistolary coming of Age Short Stories. The coursework includes four short pieces of writing and a substantial Capstone Project. Expect frequent co-editing workshops, and small-group discussion sessions besides the regularly scheduled class meetings. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: emphasis on written work, readings, artistic work.",

What forms of power did each of these thinkers surface? What social transformations did they call for? How did they imagine that transformation could be achieved? Devoting equal parts of the term to each author, we will dwell in, and move between, very different political problematics: the cultural production of woman; the psychic effects of racialized colonial rule; the perpetuation of capitalism through the sowing of false needs; the consecration of sex as identity. Yet we will also keep an eye on certain broad questions and themes. These include the production of the human subject by power; the ruses by which contingent social orders such as capitalism or colonialism come to appear as natural, total, or timeless; and the difference between surface and radical freedom. Readings will be drawn from: The Second Sex (Beauvoir); Black Skin, White Masks and The Wretched of the Earth (Fanon); Eros and Civilization and One-Dimensional Man (Marcuse); and Discipline and Punish or The History of Sexuality, Volume One (Foucault). Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: An emphasis on in-class exams, readings, in-class discussion.

    "description": "This course explores the life and writings of American author James Baldwin. Born in poverty-stricken Harlem during the Harlem Renaissance, Baldwin went on to become one of the twentieth centurys most influential essayists, novelists, orators, and political commentators---particularly around issues related to American race relations. Unapologetically black, queer, and radical Baldwins writings have become a source of resurgent public interest, particularly in the wake of todays turbulent U.S. political climate. In this course we will study key moments in Baldwins oeuvre and situate the authors work in a variety of relevant historical contexts. We will pay particular attention to reoccurring themes that sit at the center of Baldwins political philosophy including: the power of love as an animating force for social transformation; the resilient nature of black resistance; the role and responsibility of artists- as-troublemakers; the limitations of white ally-ship, the dangers (and creative possibilities) of organized religion; and the ongoing problem of global white supremacy. In addition, we will place Baldwins writings in conversation with the voices of some of his contemporaries and literary progeny. One primary concern will be how to place Baldwins writings in conversation with current debates about race, gender, sexuality, and politics in contemporary America. Why does Baldwins work seem to resonate so forcefully with the social justice concerns of today and to what ends? Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on written work including weekly journal entries, readings, oral presentations, active in-class verbal participation, group work, in-class quizzes or exams, field work or trips, visual analysis, aural analysis, dramaturgical analysis, performance analysis.",
