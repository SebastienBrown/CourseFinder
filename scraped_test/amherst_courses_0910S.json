    "description": "This course is an interdisciplinary introduction to Asian/Pacific/American Studies. We will begin by looking at the founding of the field through the student-led social movements of the 1960s and ask ourselves how relevant these origins have been to the subsequent development of the field. We will then use questions that arise from this material to guide our overview of the histories, cultures, and communities that make up the multiplicity of Asian/Pacific America. Topics will include, but not be limited to, the racialization of Asian Americans through immigrant exclusion and immigration law; the role of U.S. imperialism and global geo-politics in shaping migration from Asia to the U.S., the problems and possibilities in a pan-ethnic label like A/P/A, interracial conflict and cooperation, cultural and media representations by and about Asian Americans, diaspora, and homeland politics. In addition, throughout the semester we will practice focusing on the relationships between race, gender, class, sexuality, and nation. The ultimate goal of the course is to develop a set of analytic tools that students can then use for further research and inquiry. Limited to 20 students. Spring semester. Five College Professor Reddy.",

    "description": "(Offered as American Studies 68 and English 95, section 02.)  This course is designed to provide American Studies majors, as well as others interested in interdisciplinary work, the opportunity and support to produce a major piece of research writing on a topic of their choosing.  We will examine a wide range of materials, including photographs, paintings, legal documents, journals, poems, and plays.  The course will also introduce students to the variety of methodologies utilized by practitioners in the field of American Studies.  The specific focus of the course will be the role of place in American culture.  By studying discrete geographic locations--their histories, residents, and cultural representations--students will gain appreciation for interdisciplinary work and the development of American Studies. Requisite: American Studies 11 and 12. Open to juniors and seniors or consent of the instructor. Limited to 15 students.  Spring semester. Professor Hayashi.",

Is rationality itself culturally relative? The course will consider classical and contemporary approaches to questions such as these. Spring semester. Professor Babb.",
