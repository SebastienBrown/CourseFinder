Topics may include conflicts and accommodations between Native peoples and English settlers; changing uses of land and resources; seventeenth-century witchcraft trials; the American Revolution and Shays rebellion; religious revivalism of the Great Awakening; abolitionist and other nineteenth-century reform movements; tourism and the scenic including Thomas Cole's famous painting of the oxbow; immigration, industrialization and deindustrialization, especially in the cities of Holyoke and Springfield; educational institutions and innovations; the Cold War, the reach of the \"military industrial complex\" into local educational institutions, and \"the bunker\"; the sanctuary movement; feminist and gay activism; present environmental, mass incarceration, and other social equity issues; and of course, Emily Dickinson's poetry. Limited to 20 students per section. 8 seats per section reserved for first-year students. Fall semester. Professors Brooks and Sanchez-Eppler. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to majors, and first and second year students as this is an introductory course.

Whether we are active participants, fans, or only disinterested consumers of media, we cannot escape the influence sport has on American society. Moreover, the world of sports is the place where discussions of major societal issuesracism, gender inequality, labor rightsmost prominently arise in the public sphere. Media often point to sport as being emblematic of the most powerful myths about American culture and identity. Yet, few people have an appreciation for how sports in American society and their meaning have evolved over time. This course is designed to offer such an understanding and promote critical analysis of the role of sports in our individual and collective lives.

We will examine the history of the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy and the independent Hawaiian Kingdom, the subsequent annexation of Hawaii as a US territory, and finally the current status of Hawaii as the fiftieth state in the United States.  Topics of discussion include Native Hawaiian resistance to American annexation, indigenous land struggles and continued US military expansion after annexation, Asian sugar plantation laborer settlers in Hawaii, revitalization of Hawaiian language, and contemporary Native Hawaiian sovereignty movements for self-determination. Students will engage with a variety of primary sources (court cases, protest songs, memoirs, letters) and secondary sources (scholarly books, articles, documentaries, films) to critically examine global geopolitics and economic interests that fueled US imperialism in Hawaii as well as to understand historical and contemporary manifestations of Kanaka Maoli self-determination and Asian settler solidarity.

It also considers from many perspectives what it means to read and write and learn and teach both for ourselves and for others. As part of the work of this course, in addition to the usual class hours, students will serve as weekly tutors and classroom assistants in adult basic education centers in nearby towns. Thus, this course consciously engages with the obstacles to and the power of education through course readings, through self-reflexive writing about our own varied educational experiences, and through weekly work in the community. As an Intensive Writing course, this class further supports students as they hone deep reading strategies and multi-step writing processes themselves. Although this course presses participants to reflect a great deal about teaching, this course does not teach how to teach. Instead it offers an exploration of the contexts and processes of education, and of the politics and desires that suffuse learning. Course readings range across literary genres (ex: essays, poems, autobiographies, and novels) in which education and teaching figure centrally, as well as readings from other disciplines, which may include ethnography, sociology, psychology, and philosophy. As part of the work of Intensive Writing, students will examine not only the content of these readings but also how they are constructed. Specifically, they will study rhetorical features (ex: audience awareness and genre expectations), as well as the structures of argument and analysis, with an eye on developing reading and writing skills they can use in other courses across the College. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they reflect on their experiences as tutors and develop their own academic writing voices.

This course enables students to learn about Native American literature and art production through the Boundless exhibit, and through readings and research related to Native American artistic traditions and literary practices. As an interdisciplinary course, taught within American Studies, students will work with texts from the Amherst Native Literature collection and choose a Native artist from the Meads exhibit to study in more depth. Some questions we will consider in our class discussions: What is the relationship between text and image within different Native American artistic traditions? From ledger books to the work of Mary Sulley and more contemporary Native performers and artists, how have Indigenous creators used the site of culture to contend with the shifting challenges that arise out of settler colonialism? How have Native artists and writers collaborated to produce cultural projects that celebrate Indigenous epistemologies? How do American and Indigenous artistic practices and traditions, in terms of literature, visual art, and film, overlap, critique, or enliven one another? This course is centered around Indigenous approaches to learning and will enable students to deepen their understanding of the relationships between research, museums, archives, and Indigenous cultural representations that contend with the legacies of colonization.
