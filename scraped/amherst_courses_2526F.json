The study also found that definitions of Jewishness and Jewish communities extended beyond religion to include ancestry and culture. What terms have come to embody American Jewish experience? In what ways have Jewish communities been constituted? What fosters healthy and vibrant communities? This course offers an introduction to American Jewish Studies and community-engaged learning. Raymond Williams defines keywords as offering a shared body of words and meanings. Four keywords will frame the semesterGenerations, Service, Community, and Place. In each of these units, we will probe a range of materials: historical writing, sociology, literature, statistical analyses, films/documentaries, and personal narratives. Course materials will offer background and context for our engagement with communities outside the classroom.

All too often, when we think of education we think of the grammar of schoolingdesks, the classroom, a teacher lecturingbut some of the most exciting and creative educational work is happening in museum spaces. Museums are educational institutions in that they seek to preserve and disseminate knowledge, culture, aesthetics, and scientific insight. Museums are innovators in expanding the modes of conveying information beyond reading and writingthe written text. They have worked hard to be sites of experiential learning for students of all ages. Examining museums and education together highlights the complementary nature of these endeavors as well as their inherent tensions. How does a museums materiality affect its educational mission? What economic and political forces (philanthropy, governments, public sentiment) set and shape museums educational programming? This course introduces students to the educational mission of different kinds of museums through weekly visits to local museums and semester-long group projects with a specific museum partner. This course interrogates the opportunities and challenges of creating and sharing knowledge in museum settings and through that process provides new insights into the goals and methods of education.

By analyzing the debates over legislation to restrict the teaching of divisive concepts, as well as the associated revision of state standards in a variety of contested spaces, students will gain awareness not only of how guidelines for the teaching of social studies are created, but also why an understanding of the political process influencing curriculum and classroom instruction is vital for the protection of free speech and public education within our democracy.  With state history standards as the case study, students will complete the course having considered how educational reform is advanced, who does and should have a say in U.S. Social Studies education, and what role they wish to assume in education as a project of democracy.

Using theories, concepts, and methodologies of psychological science, this course will examine how the psychological factors underlying experiences of stereotyping and prejudice impact diverse groups at individual and group levels. Readings will come primarily from psychology (e.g., empirical and theoretical psychology research articles and literature reviews) supplemented with non-psychology readings (e.g., book chapters, videos, podcasts, and media articles) to connect contemporary issues with psychological research. As this is an upper-level advanced seminar, students will be expected to lead and participate in weekly class discussions and reflection, as well as produce a comprehensive project focusing on research and application (e.g., proposing and conducting a study).  While this course aims to address stereotypes and prejudice of multiple and diverse marginalized groups, one such group among them will include the Asian American & Pacific Islander communitythus, this course is cross-listed with the Asian American / Pacific Islander Studies major.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course. Chronologically, we will cover the period between the 7th and the 20th centuries, with heavy focus on the modern period (from the 17th century on). The class discussions will be based on classical and new historical scholarship and will involve analysis of primary historical sources.  Two class meetings per week. Fall semester.

Among the questions we will address are: When, how, and why was the Quran first copied as a written text? Why does the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, completed in 6912 A.D., closely resemble Christian churches and shrines from the same period? Why did medieval Europeans judge objects from the Islamic world, especially those bearing Arabic script, to be sacred in nature? How did commercial and diplomatic exchanges with China and Viking Scandinavia impact the arts of Central Asia and the Middle East during the premodern period? What can contemporary comic books tell us about the visual logic of fifteenth-century Iranian manuscript painting? And how have nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists used photography and film to address the legacies of colonialism and Orientalism? We will attempt to answer these questions through close and careful analysis of objects in a range of media, from silver and rock crystal to silk textiles and video; cities and architectural sites in Spain and India, and the many places in between; and primary and secondary texts. Films, museum websites, musical recordings, and visits to the Mead Art Museum and Amhersts Archives and Special Collections will supplement readings, lectures, and discussions.

        "description": "This course is an introduction to Japanese literature through the study of contemporary fiction. The late 1970s is widely viewed as the beginning of a major remapping of Japanese literature, embodied most famously in the novels of Haruki Murakami. In the 1990s, Nobel laureate Kenzaburo Oe criticized this new literature for what he perceived as a lack of social and political engagement. Others, however, have celebrated its playfulness and flirtation with the fantastic, viewing these two features, in particular, as an engagement with globalization. In this course, we will survey this body of new writing in Japan from the late 1970s to the present. Murakami may be the best known, but women writers are globally prominent in this new literature. We will read writers who are gaining reputations around the globe, writers who are not widely known outside Japan, popular genre writers, bilingual writers, and writers representing ethnic minorities. All texts are taught using English translations, though students who can read Japanese are encouraged to read some of the material in the original. Fall semester. Professor Van Compernolle.

Miller (1986) in his book Nihongo (Japanese), writes: The Japanese writing system is, without question, the most complicated and involved system of script employed today by any nation on earth; it is also one of the most complex orthographies ever employed by any culture anywhere at any time in human history. The difficulty lies not merely in the number of characters that students must learn (roughly a couple of thousand), but also in the unpredictable nature of the ways these characters are used in Japanese. It is not possible in regular Japanese language courses to spend very much time on the writing system because the students must learn other aspects of the language in a limited number of class hours. This writing system is, however, not impossible to learn. In this half course, the students will learn the Japanese writing system historically and metacognitively, in group as well as individual sessions, and aim to overcome preconceived notions of difficulty related to the learning of Kanji. Each student in this course is expected to master roughly 500 Kanji that are used in different contexts. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Tawa.

Important readings in this part of the course include Black Odyssey by Nathan Huggins, Racism: A Short History by George Frederickson, and The Black Jacobins by C. L. R. James. The second half of the course addresses important themes from the turn of the twentieth century to the present. Beginning with The Souls of Black Folk by W. E. B. Du Bois, it proceeds through a range of seminal texts, including The Wretched of the Earth by Frantz Fanon and The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin. This part of the course utilizes Revising Prose by Richard Lanham to extend the lesson in reading from the first half of the semester into an exploration of precision and style in writing. Computer exercises based on Revising Prose and three short essaysone on a single book, another comparing two books, and the last on a major theme in the courseprovide the main opportunity to apply and reinforce skills in reading and writing learned throughout the semester.

This course introduces students to African urban environments while also engaging the social, political, economic, and cultural phenomena that have shaped the lives of these locales. Some of the places that we will consider include: the Pyramids of Giza; the ancient Nubian pyramids of Sudan; the Medieval site of Great Zimbabwe; the coral stone cities of the early modern Swahili Coast of East Africa; the ports of the West African slave trade; the twentieth-century colonial cities of French West Africa and Italian East Africa; and modern urban centers from Casablanca, Morocco to Antananarivo, Madagascar. Traversing the continent while simultaneously moving from ancient to modern times, this course introduces students to the broad range of questions that emerge when we investigate the cities, buildings, landscapes, and cultures of Africa. Students will hone their reading, writing, and research skills through response essays, position papers, and a final research project.

Individual freedom to create? Something old that your parents listen to? Jazz emerged in New Orleans in the early twentieth century and quickly spread throughout the world, becoming, at certain points in its history, wildly popular, and at others, decidedly esoteric. Jazz has been called, variously: savage, modern, instinctive, sophisticated, revolutionary, a rare national treasure, a secret sonic weapon, noise, America's classical music, and the most powerful evolutionary force in modern music. It has been instrumental in political movements (for instance, the export of jazz ensembles to the Soviet Union during the Cold War); in campaigns both to sanction human rights (Jazz in the Civil Rights Movement), and suppress them (its concerted and systematic effort to exclude women); and it has been used at once to amplify capitalism (the market-savvy Smooth Jazz industry) and to critique it (the efflorescence of independent musician collectives, such as the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). Using audio recordings, newspaper articles, television programs, and other archival materials, along with recent and past scholarship, we will examine the sounds, key figures, and practices that make up this music to consider what this enduring yet elusive style has to tell us about ourselves.

These migration flows are raising new questions about the nature of politics, economics, and culture in various African national and transnational contexts.  To explore the political, social, and economic consequences of these waves of migration in African states and among countries receiving African migrants, this course will examine the following topics at the core of the transformation of African states in the global age:  colonialism and the construction of modern African states; globalization and political legitimacy in postcolonial African states; globalization and African labor migration; globalization and African popular culture; globalization and Africa's new religious movements; globalization and Africa's refugee crisis; Africa and globalization of the media; Africa and the global discourse on gender and sexuality; Africa and the global discourse on AIDS/HIV; Africa and the globalization of football (soccer).  Course readings will focus not only on the impact of globalization and state crisis on African societies, but also on how emerging national and transnational African populations are shaping the processes of globalization.

How might the category of sexuality act as an additional optic through which to view and reframe contemporary and historical debates concerning the construction of black identity? In what ways have traditional understandings of masculinity and femininity contributed to an understanding of African American life and culture as invariably heterosexual? How have black lesbian, gay, and transgendered persons effected political change through their theoretical articulations of identity, difference, and power? In this interdisciplinary course, we will address these questions through an examination of the complex roles gender and sexuality play in the lives of people of African descent. Remaining attentive to the ways black people have claimed social and sexual agency in spite of systemic modes of inequality, we will engage with critical race theory, black feminist thought, queer-of-color critique, literature, art, film, new media and erotica, as well as scholarship from anthropology, sociology, and history.

By the end of 1804, the white planter class had been killed or exiled and Black men ruled the island. Before it happened, white slave masters could never imagine that tens of thousands of enslaved Africans would one day break their chains and succeed in defeating French, British, and Spanish armies. For millions of enslaved people, the Haitian Revolution proved that the dream of freedom could become reality and inspired slave conspiracies and rebellions from Virginia to Brazil. At the same time, Haiti struck fear in white slave masters throughout the Americas, who did their best to strangle the new Black Republic in its cradle.

The second part of the course will introduce research methods in three important areas of Black Studies: the arts, history, and the social sciences. Faculty members of the Black Studies Department, departmental affiliates, and visitors will join the class to present their own ongoing research, placing particular emphasis on the disciplinary methods and traditions of inquiry that guide their efforts. Also in the second part, through individual meetings with professors, students will begin developing their own research projects. The third part of the course will concentrate more fully on development of these projects through a classroom workshop. Here students will learn how to shape a topic into a research question, build a bibliography, annotate a bibliography, shape a thesis, develop an outline, and write a research proposal, or prospectus.

Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb.  Browns last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis.  This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions:  what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights?  In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves.  Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level.  In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights.  Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans.

In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.  We will focus on African Americans efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others. Course assignments will consist of weekly responses; two short papers; and one longer essay designed to allow students to delve into some aspect of the course in depth.

        "description": "(Offered as ARHA 432 and CLAS 432) Sicily holds a special place in the ancient Mediterranean world, geographically and culturally. Its location as a stopover point in the Western Mediterranean made it into a site of fierce colonization by Greeks, Carthaginians, and eventually Romans, demonstrating along the way the complexities of cultural interactions among these rival groups. Rome in essence learned to become an empire there, in and after the First Punic War (264-241 BCE). Sicily would become a crucial source of grain as the empire grew and was, already under Greek rule, a place of immense wealth and the luxury that went with it, especially the cultured luxury of the Greek material world (architecture, statuary, painting, pottery, among other things). This course focuses on Sicily as a site of intense cultural flourishing under Greeks and Romans, with a particular emphasis on the material culture of the island and the interconnections of its literary and artistic legacies. This is a research-oriented seminar, intended for students wanting to learn the craft of research, whether for their academic work generally or in preparation for writing an honors thesis. Students will develop several research skills: planning and time management for research projects, the production of annotated bibliographies, the use of standard academic resources (handbooks, journal databases, other online resources), the analysis of and writing about texts and objects, and the crafting of original research ideas. The class builds up to the writing of a research paper as the final project and also addresses writing an abstract and delivering a professional talk about ones research. Three class hours per week, plus participation in one day-long writing retreat. Limited to twenty students. Fall semester. Professor van den Berg. How to handle overenrollment: Other things being equal, preference will be given to Classics majors. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment:  Reading, visual analysis, field trips, written work, research skills, oral presentations, group work, group discussion, and class participation.",

The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality.

        "description": "In this class, we will engage in a pluralist approach to applied micro. What is pluralism, and what is applied micro? Pluralist economics challenges and reconceptualizes the methods, topics, models, values, and pedagogy of economic practice. By taking a diverse big-tent approach to how to do economics, pluralist econ aspires to reinvigorate the \"social\" in the social science of economics, while also de-emphasizing some of the \"science\" (at least the scientific posturing). It includes ecological, cooperative, Marxist, feminist, stratification, and antiracist varieties of economic practice. Applied microeconomics also understands itself as modern and innovative: it employs the tools of economics to provide insight into individual behavior and societal outcomes, and is perceived by mainstream economists as interdisciplinary, creative, and diverse. However, in its strict adherence to the norms of mainstream economics  methodological individualism, mathematical formalization, prioritization of efficiency, and blindness to power  applied micro may instead be seen, from a pluralist perspective, as rigid, doctrinaire, and homogeneous. This practicum brings pluralism to applied micro via two complementary endeavors. First, as a group, we will employ pluralist framings to explore the applied micro literature. Second, as individuals, each student will implement a pluralist approach to an applied micro research project. Our two class meetings each week will be shared equally between these endeavors: one for seminar-style discussion of literature, one for practicum work on individual research in community. The aspiration is to do economics in a way that is adventurous rather than imperialist, curious and exploratory rather than settler colonial, and humanistic rather than narrowly scientific. Requisite: Econ 300/301; Econ 360/361. Also, one course on non-mainstream economics, racial capitalism, Marxism, history of economic thought, or sociology applied to economies; examples from within econ include Econ 205, Econ 211, Econ 416, or Econ 300 from Fall 2022.

In this class, students will examine the way that journalists present the written word in print and digital spaces to inform, analyze, and present opinionsas we do the same in our own writing. We will pay close attention to the way that reporter teams explicitly and implicitly build arguments, use evidence, organize texts, and edit their own work, with an eye on developing strategies for using these skills in class assignments, and transferring them to other classes as well. The class challenges students, through critical writing, to come to terms with our responsibilities as engaged citizens for understanding, and acting on, the information we encounter in the news. Through writing projects that ask students to examine conversations on current events, particularly those relating to social and racial justice, students will develop skills to evaluate and contribute to the multimedia news landscape. Readings will explore media literacy and the rhetoric of news and will include a range of news and academic articles, as well as digital forms (such as podcasts, videos, and web texts). Students can expect to learn about: developing and strengthening ideas; paragraphing; building and sustaining arguments; using and citing evidence; and offering and responding to feedback. Students will explore pre-writing, drafting, and revision practices. They will have the opportunity to write low-stakes, informal assignments like journals as well as three formal papers. Students should expect a mixture of class discussion, writing exercises, and peer review during class time. They should also expect to attend writing consultations with the professor outside of class. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they develop their own academic writing voices.

        "description": "The United States is in an unprecedented period of rising inequality. This course begins by examining the history of inequality in the U.S. since the start of the twentieth century. It then uses cutting-edge and detailed national data to document and explore the current state of inequality and intergenerational mobility in the U.S. We consider inequality by various metrics, such as race, gender, and geography, and in various outcomes, such as income, wealth, health, educational attainment, and incarceration. The course then examines determinants of inequality, and finally, investigates policy solutions to inequality. Throughout the course, economic models related to inequality are both presented and critiqued. Finally, special attention is paid throughout the course to causal inference, and to students honing their skills at understanding the intuition behind commonly used research methods to estimate causal effects. Requisites: ECON 111/ECON 111E. Limited to 30 students. Fall and spring semesters. Professor Hyman. How to handle overenrollment: Some preference will be given to a) students who have taken fewer 200 level economics classes and b) economics majors.

Coursework includes an interdisciplinary blend of scholarly readings, in-class dialogue, experiential learning activities, reflective writing, and an intergroup collaborative research project. Students in this course bring their own experiences with race into the classroom as a legitimate and valued source for learning. The course readings link students personal experiences around race to a socio-historical understanding of individual, institutional, and structural discrimination--to the ways social inequality is embedded in social institutions and individual consciousness, constraining life chances. Early in the course students engage in structured activities that develop trust among participants.  Coursework and learn skills at intergroup dialogue--suspending judgment and listening for understanding--in order to create respectful, sustained dialogues around racial divisions.  Students engage in small mixed-race teams to research a racial inequality/inequity on campus. Students do reflective writing weekly,, linking their in-class experiences to the readings, as well as reflective writing at the end about their learning throughout the semester. The course exposes participants in a very intimate way to how classmates of different races see and experience the world, to the pain and trauma students of color may have undergone due to race, and to the privilege White students possess, whether or not they are aware of it.

All too often, when we think of education we think of the grammar of schoolingdesks, the classroom, a teacher lecturingbut some of the most exciting and creative educational work is happening in museum spaces. Museums are educational institutions in that they seek to preserve and disseminate knowledge, culture, aesthetics, and scientific insight. Museums are innovators in expanding the modes of conveying information beyond reading and writingthe written text. They have worked hard to be sites of experiential learning for students of all ages. Examining museums and education together highlights the complementary nature of these endeavors as well as their inherent tensions. How does a museums materiality affect its educational mission? What economic and political forces (philanthropy, governments, public sentiment) set and shape museums educational programming? This course introduces students to the educational mission of different kinds of museums through weekly visits to local museums and semester-long group projects with a specific museum partner. This course interrogates the opportunities and challenges of creating and sharing knowledge in museum settings and through that process provides new insights into the goals and methods of education.

By analyzing the debates over legislation to restrict the teaching of divisive concepts, as well as the associated revision of state standards in a variety of contested spaces, students will gain awareness not only of how guidelines for the teaching of social studies are created, but also why an understanding of the political process influencing curriculum and classroom instruction is vital for the protection of free speech and public education within our democracy.  With state history standards as the case study, students will complete the course having considered how educational reform is advanced, who does and should have a say in U.S. Social Studies education, and what role they wish to assume in education as a project of democracy.

Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb.  Browns last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis.  This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions:  what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights?  In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves.  Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level.  In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights.  Navigating articles, media clips, monographs, edited works, oral histories, and art, this class will delve into the role of traditional and unconventional politics in the creation of policies that affect the lives of all Americans.

In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.  We will focus on African Americans efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others.

We will pay close attention to the way that reporter teams explicitly and implicitly build arguments, use evidence, organize texts, and edit their own work, with an eye on developing strategies for using these skills in class assignments, and transferring them to other classes as well. The class challenges students, through critical writing, to come to terms with our responsibilities as engaged citizens for understanding, and acting on, the information we encounter in the news. Through writing projects that ask students to examine conversations on current events, particularly those relating to social and racial justice, students will develop skills to evaluate and contribute to the multimedia news landscape. Readings will explore media literacy and the rhetoric of news and will include a range of news and academic articles, as well as digital forms (such as podcasts, videos, and web texts). Students can expect to learn about: developing and strengthening ideas; paragraphing; building and sustaining arguments; using and citing evidence; and offering and responding to feedback. Students will explore pre-writing, drafting, and revision practices. They will have the opportunity to write low-stakes, informal assignments like journals as well as three formal papers. Students should expect a mixture of class discussion, writing exercises, and peer review during class time. They should also expect to attend writing consultations with the professor outside of class. Ultimately, students will come together as a community of writers who support one another as they develop their own academic writing voices. Preference given to first-year Amherst College students recommended for Intensive Writing. Admission with consent of the instructor and/or the Director of Intensive Writing. Limited to 15 students. Two sections in the fall semester. Lecturer Reardon. How to handle overenrollment: Preference given to first-year Amherst College students recommended for Intensive Writing.

Together, we will make our way through snow, sleet, hurricanes, cyclones, tropical storms, superstorms, and some light everyday rain. This topic will provide a unifying thematic thread for a class focused on the fundamentals of close reading, writing, critical thinking, and argumentation. We will examine how various genres, narrative styles, and authorial voices engage this common topic in strikingly different ways. We will also use storms to learn about literary and aesthetic concepts. Together, we will discuss how storms blur lines between setting, plot, characterization, suspense, and closure. We will use storms to focus on the fundamentals of college-level close reading, delving deep into the language writers use to make storms come to life on the page.? We will consider the intersection of environmental and human violence. And we will examine the ways in which storms exposes and exacerbate disparities along racial and socioeconomic lines. Keep in mind that while storms happen to be our theme, more than anything, this is a course about reading texts, writing about texts, and thinking with texts. This course introduces students to college-level reading and writing skills. We will focus on how writing can be a mode of thinking, and how reading and writing become intertwined with one another. Authors may include Jesmyn Ward, Zora Neale Hurston, Ben Lerner, Lauren Groff, and Jenny Offill. Limited to 18 students. Fall semester. Professor Abramson.

Chained anguish has no avenue into ordinary socialized language, and so its tremendous energies can only be sucked into the interior of the self or expressed in non-normative waysin dwindled-down rhythms, for instance, or strange lingerings and leaps.

This advanced poetry workshop will focus on this emerging tradition of radical visual-textual hybrid artmaking, centering writerly process over final product, and potentiality-driven experiments with the space of the page. Starting from Douglas Kearneys assertion that his poetry is often guided by an impulse to fail, this class will write our own collective craft lexicon of visual poetics, with topics of study which include line and space(ing), visual syntax, collage, hybridity, erasure, and docu-poetics. Class time will center theory-informed discussions of creative works, as well as practical software demonstrations and peer workshop critique. This workshops final project will culminate in producing extensive visual poem installations, individually and collectively. We will examine the critical and creative works of artists such as Douglas Kearney, Etel Adnan, Anthony Cody, Renee Gladman, Claire Meuschke, Fargo Tbakhi, and Tarik Dobbs. Limited to 12 students.

Coursework will include close collaborations with The Emily Dickinson Museum and rare access to the Dickinson manuscripts housed at Amherst College archives and special collections. Thus, in this course we will have the extraordinary opportunity to read these poems in Amherst, to study both her individual life and her practices of literary expression in the place where she lived and wrote and with access to her manuscripts and to many of the spaces, artifacts, and records of family and local history. It is a complicated history, and starting with new scholarship on the roles the Dickinson family played in the white settlement of the Connecticut River Valley, this class will be particularly attuned to the inequalities of race, class, and gender that structure Dickinson's poetic practice and legacy.

        "description": "(Offered as ENGL 387 and FAMS ) As an industry in the business of making both entertainment and art, Hollywood is a fascinating case study to explore. This course will focus on how contemporary Hollywood works and how understanding its work can enable us also to understand how films work. Our first unit will begin by exploring the context of industrial and independent practices through six key examples, which will form the primary models for the course throughout the semester. With some overlap between them, each film will enable us to look at various aspects of movie-making, whether through particular creative roles (e.g., director, screenwriter, director of photography, producer, actors) or through other aspects of production (e.g., studio, genre, location, exhibition). Students will compose an essay that examines 1-2 creative roles in a particular film (or one particular role across two films). The second unit of the course will build on the first, as we will focus on the same set of films, but from a more analytical perspective to emphasize cultural and textual analysis. In this unit, students will therefore have the choice to investigate one of the previous films for further research, ultimately producing an exploratory essay that brings together contextual and textual analysis. The final unit of the course will focus on a final project that considers how we might pitch one of our central films for production in Hollywood today. Readings throughout the course will be drawn from popular and academic sources that focus on our central films in relation to the primary roles or fields of inquiry of the respective units. Case studies will likely include the following six films: Die Hard (John McTiernan, 1988), Speed (Jan de Bont, 1994), Somethings Gotta Give (Nancy Meyers, 2003), Creed (Ryan Coogler, 2015), The Rider (Chloe Zhao, 2017), and Everything Everywhere All at Once (Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, 2022).

This course centers what one First Nations playwright calls BIPOC takeovers of Shakespeares work.

Topics to be explored include the utility of colonial texts for decolonial futures; the relation of land, language, and literature; the transformation of Euro-American theatre through non-Western artistic practice and ceremony; and the recent development of anti-racist initiatives that challenge and reinvent the study, staging, and teaching of Shakespeares plays.

We will think about the formal, imaginative, and ethical challenges of thinking on a global scale. We will discuss how one can preserve awareness of local differences and historical contingencies when thinking on a global scale. We will examine the sorts of identities that get forged across borders. We will talk about what happens to setting when texts range across nations and even continents.

Is there even a stable notion of what is natural that can be deployed in a workable environmental ethic? What obligations, if any, do we have to future generations? Can there be overpopulation and if so, how many should live on our planet?

Bringing together insights and approaches from fields as diverse as history, philosophy, religious studies, anthropology, literature, gender studies, the performing and visual arts, cultural studies, and communication studies, practitioners of the Environmental Humanities have been exploring new ways to understand, evaluate, and address planetary ecological crises and sustainability issues. In this course, we will introduce students to the key concepts and influential texts that animate this exciting sphere of inquiry. In addition to visits from several guest speakers, we will travel to regional museums and outdoor spaces. Students will write throughout the semester, and they will also pursue independent research that explores some aspect of the Environmental Humanities. Limited to 25 students.

        "description": "(Offered as GEOL-253 and ENST-253) Geospatial inquiry is an iterative creative process that involves asking, answering, and communicating the results of questions using data linked to geographic locations. The anticipated results of this process are thoughtfully assembled maps and geographic datasets that serve as accessible, persuasive, and even beautiful means of conveying large amounts of complex information. Geospatial thinking is a critical skill for pursuing a systems-based perspective on our rapidly changing and interconnected world. This course is a hands-on introduction to geospatial inquiry using geographic information systems (GIS) software applied to a variety of intersecting topics in environmental studies, natural science, and the humanities. Technical topics include geospatial data acquisition and database management, coordinate systems and projections, creation and manipulation of raster and vector datasets, data digitization, incorporation of field data into GIS, use of lidar, aerial imagery, and other remote sensing tools, and the production of professional-quality final maps. While there is a lecture component in the course, students will mainly be engaged in active learning in the form of skills tutorials, reflection and discussion assignments, independent and peer troubleshooting, and question-driven projects.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course.

In this introductory English course, we will read and watch Arthurian legends from Chaucer to Monty Python, examining the ways in which they have been represented in different eras. Beginning with the historical foundations of the King Arthur legend, we will examine how it blossomed and took form in later eras. Our focus will be on close literary and visual analysis of British, American, and French (in translation) versions of these legends. We will also discuss what cultural forces lie behind the popularity of Arthurian legend in certain eras: later medieval England and France; the Victorian era; and twentieth-century England and America.

We will consider how these artworks and monuments were products of cultural exchange and imperial entanglements with Africa, the Americas, South and East Asia, and the Ottoman Empire. While we study objects of luxury, we will learn about the territorial expansion, extraction of resources, and exploitation of human beings that allowed the arts to flourish in Europe during these tumultuous and formative centuries. The course will follow a roughly chronological arc, from Columbuss invasion of the Americas in 1492 to the French and Haitian Revolutions in the 1790s. Lectures will be thematic, covering topics like changing conceptions of artistic labor, how portraiture shaped gender, the material cultures of coffee and tea, and imperialist landscapes. In addition to lectures, we will study objects in person in local collections, experiment with making, and build research and writing skills.

Cloth is central to self-expression and identity, community and tradition, and comfort and care. At the same time, cloth has played a fundamental part in global histories of colonialism, industrialization, extraction, and trade.

        "description": "(Offered as SPAN-347, FAMS-328, EUST 347 and SWAG-357) Pedro Almodovar has defined world cinema for the last five decades. As Spains most celebrated film director, Almodovar has created his own cinematic universe. Almodovar lit up Spains movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almodovar has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almodovar films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almodovars ongoing dialogue with Spains social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States. This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required. Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor.  Limited to 25 students.

How can we address a phenomenon that has disappeared the moment we apprehend it? How does memory operate in our critical perception of an event? How does a body make meaning? These are a few of the questions we will explore in this course, as we discuss critical, theoretical, and compositional approaches in a broad range of multidisciplinary performance phenomena emerging from Europeanprimarily Germanculture in the twentieth century. We will focus on issues of performativity, composition, conceptualization, dramaturgy, identity construction, representation, race, space, gender, and dynamism. Readings of performance theory, performance studies, gender studies, and critical/cultural studies, as well as literary, philosophical, and architectural texts, will accompany close examination of performance material. Students will develop performative projects in various media (video, performance, text, online) and deliver a number of critical oral and written presentations on various aspects of the course material and their own projects. Performance material will be experienced live when possible, and in text, video, audio, digital media and online form, drawn from selected works of Dada and Surrealism, Bauhaus, German Expressionism, the Theater of the Absurd, Tanztheater, and Contemporary Theater, Performance, Dance, Opera, New Media, and Performance Art. A number of films, including Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari , Oskar Schlemmers Das Triadische Ballett , Fernand Legers Ballet Mecanique , and Kurt Jooss Der Grune Tisch , will also be screened.

This course will focus on how contemporary Hollywood works and how understanding its work can enable us also to understand how films work. Our first unit will begin by exploring the context of industrial and independent practices through six key examples, which will form the primary models for the course throughout the semester. With some overlap between them, each film will enable us to look at various aspects of movie-making, whether through particular creative roles (e.g., director, screenwriter, director of photography, producer, actors) or through other aspects of production (e.g., studio, genre, location, exhibition). Students will compose an essay that examines 1-2 creative roles in a particular film (or one particular role across two films). The second unit of the course will build on the first, as we will focus on the same set of films, but from a more analytical perspective to emphasize cultural and textual analysis. In this unit, students will therefore have the choice to investigate one of the previous films for further research, ultimately producing an exploratory essay that brings together contextual and textual analysis. The final unit of the course will focus on a final project that considers how we might pitch one of our central films for production in Hollywood today. Readings throughout the course will be drawn from popular and academic sources that focus on our central films in relation to the primary roles or fields of inquiry of the respective units.

Working both individually and collaboratively, participants will develop a body of work that reflects their engagement with the site, experimenting with different modes of documentary filmmaking (observational, participatory, poetic, etc.). Through hands-on production, critique, and discussion, students will refine their approach to cinematography, sound, and editing while considering questions of representation, form, and storytelling. The course will also include critiques, historical and contemporary screenings, technical workshops, and guest visits from filmmakers working in the field. Over the semester, students will create their own short videos as part of a collective project that combines their varied perspectives, culminating in a final public screening. Requisite: A prior 200-level production course or relevant experience (to be discussed with the instructor in advance of the first class). Limited to 12 students.

They will be expected to cultivate a responsive and adaptive approach to filmmaking in the field, working in dynamic environments where observation, timing, and ethical considerations shape creative decision-making. Participants will also exercise critical thinking in analyzing form, modes of representation and narrative structure. The collaborative, community-based exchange component of this course will help students foster a sensitivity to varying perspectives, experiences and creative methodologies. Students will be evaluated on their ability to integrate technical proficiency with conceptual rigor in their work, demonstrating growth in both individual projects and collective contributions. Active participation in discussions and critiques will be crucial, as will a willingness to experiment and take creative risks. The final assessment will emphasize the depth of engagement with the filmmaking process, the clarity of artistic and documentary intent, and the ability to synthesize feedback into refined, considered work.",

From the noble lie of Plato's Republic to the controversy about former President Clinton's \"lying\" in the Monica Lewinsky case and President Trumps alleged assault on truth, from the use of secrecy in the war against terrorism to the endless spinning of political campaigns, from controversies about \"fake news\" to efforts to hide and excuse police miscoduct, from President John Kennedy's behavior during the Cuban missile crisis to cover-ups concerning pedophile priests in the Catholic church, from Freud's efforts to decode the secrets beneath civilized life to contemporary exposes of the private lives of politicians, politics and deception seem to go hand-in-hand. This course investigates how the practices of politics are informed by the keeping and telling of secrets, and the telling and exposing of lies. We will address such questions as: When, if ever, is it right to lie or to breach confidences? When is it right to expose secrets and lies? Is it necessary to be prepared to lie in order to advance the cause of justice? Or, must we do justice justly? When is secrecy really necessary and when is it merely a pretext for Machiavellian manipulation? Are secrecy and deceit more prevalent in some kinds of political systems than in others? Can democracy survive in a post-truth era? As we explore those questions we will discuss the place of candor and openness in politics and social life; the relationship between the claims of privacy (e.g., the closeting of sexual desire) and secrecy and deception in public arenas; conspiracy theories as they are applied to politics; and the importance of secrecy in the domains of national security and law enforcement. We will examine the treatment of secrecy and lying in political theory as well as their appearance in literature and popular culture, for example Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , Primary Colors , Schindler's List and The Insider. This is a discussion-based course. Students will be expected to be active participants in the seminar. During the course of the semester we will use our discussions to cultivate reasoning skills as well as student capacities to present arguments in a compelling manner. In addition, there will be frequent writing, and I will provide careful and extended responses to student writing. The course will provide an introduction to liberal studies by helping students learn how to read and comprehend complex texts, respond to them in sophisticated ways, and engage in critical reasoning about venerable and pressing ethical, social and political problems.

This statement has assumed the quality of a truism: we hear it repeated by the President of the United States, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and the President of the International Criminal Court. At the same time, though, that everyone seems to agree that the \"rule of law\" is a good thing, no one seems able to say for sure what the \"rule of law\" is. What, then, do we mean by the \"rule of law\"? What does it mean to speak of government limited by law? What are these limits, where do they come from, and how are they enforced? What role does the \"rule of law\" play in legitimating structures of governance? Does the \"rule of law\" imply any particular relationship between legality and morality? We will hazard answers to these questions through a close reading of works of theorists such as John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, H.L.A. Hart and Lon Fuller. In addition, we will examine the arguments of the theorists as they help us think through pressing legal challenges of our age, such as defining the limits of executive power in the \"war against terror.\" Our seminar will be devoted to the close reading of a select number of texts. We will analyze the structure, meaning and adequacy of the arguments contained in these works through vigorous discussion and frequent writing assignments.

In addition to reading about them, we will examine actual objects. Discussions and writing assignments will develop approaches to enrich and inform these encounters through research, visual examination and critical analysis. This course will also involve making things. Through a series of studio projects (drawing and sculpture) we will explore how things are made and gain a richer understanding of their physical, visual and tactile qualities.

We will begin with the invention of the atomic bomb during World War II, exploring its societal, environmental, and cultural effects in Japan as well as its broader impact on American and European politics and identity. We will then examine the diverse ramifications of the nuclear arms race in the 1950s and 1960s, and again in the 1980s, which both pushed the world towards the brink of destruction and also fostered new forms of international cooperation and grassroots activism. We will also analyze the continuing debates over nuclear technology in the context of energy, natural resources, scientific responsibility, and environmentalism.

        "description": "In matters of conquest, political alliance, or arts and letters, Frances interactions with Italy during the sixteenth century have left a significant imprint on its history, its language and literature, and even its national identity. With the Italian Renaissance preceding the French, French rulers, thinkers, and artists alike looked across the Alps for inspiration and innovation, and voyages to Italy almost became an obligatory rite of passage for the educated Frenchman. Alongside this admiration, however, was a growing sentiment of suspicion and even rejection, deploring the presence of Italians in the French court. This course will explore some of the complexities of these relationships by developing three principal threads. The first will examine the dual role of the Italian language and its vernacular poetry, at once model and rival, in the development of the French language and its poetic production. The second thread places French writers and thinkers on the path to Italy to investigate instead their observations and representations of their Italian experience. And finally, we will read a number of texts expressing the discontent of the French with Italian presence on their soil. We will pay particular attention to those works targeting the Queen Mother (Catherine de Medici) and those attacking Machiavelli to better understand the phenomenon of machiavelisme, its contribution to Italophobia, and its role in Frances religious wars. All French texts will be read in French. Italian texts will be read in French or English translation. Students with knowledge of Italian may read texts in the original language. Conducted in French.

For Freud, the essence of repression lies simply in turning something away, and keeping it at a distance, from the conscious. Examining repression in both its personal and social dimensions in these works, we will ask ourselves just what it is that comes to be unbearable to the conscious, to what effect it is repressed, and whether it may (be made to) return. We will thus study how writers and filmmakers give voice to and work through powerful repressions operating within their own consciousness and within social consciousness more broadly: the repression of the body, of the spirit, of history (e.g., the colonial past), of race, and of social class. Authors and filmmakers may include Freud, Kristeva, Celine, Camus, Daoud, Fanon, Hondo, Alice Diop, and  Ernaux. Class conducted in French. Prerequisites: FREN-207, FREN-208, or the equivalent.

When it comes to articulating such notions as race and belonging, what can visual media achieve that literature cannot? What does it mean to designate a film as racialized or F/francophone in the context of French debates concerning universalism or communitarianism? The class will attend to the ways that the notions of nation, state, and citizenship are bound up in portrayals of Othering and will examine the complexities of what scholars such as Celis and Marks call the skin or the fleshliness inherent in filmic form. It will consider the sensuous and affective dimensions of these films and the ways in which directorial choices fragment or suture viewing communities in the shadows of racio-colonial systems.

In this course, we will focus our attention on the Grand Canyon, Rocky Mountain and Glacier National Parks, Yellowstone, Yosemite, and the Columbia Plateau. By placing these parks in their geologic context, students will gain a framework within which the geology of many additional western landscapes and national parks can be understood.

In this course we will explore Earth from its core to its surface, from the mountains to the deep ocean basins, from the past and present to the future.

What physical processes drive this dynamism? How does the restless nature of Earth impact our residency? Studying active geologic processes will provide us with a  means to decode the history of Earth as written in rocks; analyzing the rock record allows us to test  hypotheses about the formation and continual modification of the planet.

Our course follows this question across seventeen centuries of history, literature, art, politics, and culture in German-speaking Europe. Stops include the heroic epics and courtly lyrics of the medieval period; mystical treatises and Humanistic plague texts; the northern Renaissance and the rise of urban life; the revolutions of printing, Luther's Reformation and the Peasants' Revolt; witchcraft and gallows humor; the Thirty Years' War and vernacular autobiography; the Baroque and the rise of Absolutism; and end with the clashes of Prussian expansionism, the German Enlightenment and Sturm und Drang . Along the way, we will engage critically with issues of community, language and identity in these histories, as well as their appropriation by later centuries.

Students will select and pursue a semester-long research project early in the semester in consultation with the professor, and present their research in its various stages of development throughout the semester in a variety of media formats (including writing, performance, video, electronic art/interactive media, installation, online and networked events, architectural/design drawings/renderings), along with oral presentations of readings and other materials. Students writing a thesis may choose to focus their individual research project on their thesis research. Conducted in English and/or German, with an additional weekly research workshop/discussion section in German for German speakers as needed. German majors will select a research project focused on a German Studies context and do a substantial portion of their research and writing in German. Throughout, we will identify strategies for framing research questions, for gathering and digesting research materials from various sources, and for employing this research in projects of writing and creation according to individual student interest. We will examine how writers, artists, dancers, performers, filmmakers, and architects employ research in the development of their work, and students will explore and articulate the ways in which they can perform their research in all forms of writing, performance, design, and the visual and electronic arts according to their own interests and experience.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course.

This course will help students to create a distance needed to analyze the big ideas and the meaning beneath them and help acquire skills for exploration of the origin of key social and political concepts, their development and impact.  The readings for this class will take students on a journey through the battle of ideas in Europe at the end of the 19th and early 20th century when tensions and paradoxes of modernity surfaced in the form of political and social divisions. This journey will continue through the Age of Extremes and the confrontation between Communism, Fascism, and renewed Liberalism observing the legacy of this defining for the 20th century history moment.

This course explores answers to this question by focusing on the multi-faith and multicultural Mediterranean between the eighth-fifteenth centuries  prior to the rise of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the ideas it spawned about race that have violently shaped the present.

Over the course of the semester, students will be introduced to the literary, historical, and art historical frameworks and sources for the study of premodern race in such spheres as the law, religion, gender, enslavement, violence, and status. Through close reading of texts, images, and objects, we will consider the contingencies and complexities of race-making within and across the communities of the medieval Mediterranean. The course will also examine the legacy of premodern race in shaping modern ideologies, curricula, and politics.

These migration flows are raising new questions about the nature of politics, economics, and culture in various African national and transnational contexts.  To explore the political, social, and economic consequences of these waves of migration in African states and among countries receiving African migrants, this course will examine the following topics at the core of the transformation of African states in the global age:  colonialism and the construction of modern African states; globalization and political legitimacy in postcolonial African states; globalization and African labor migration; globalization and African popular culture; globalization and Africa's new religious movements; globalization and Africa's refugee crisis; Africa and globalization of the media; Africa and the global discourse on gender and sexuality; Africa and the global discourse on AIDS/HIV; Africa and the globalization of football (soccer).

What about the late Roman world encouraged such violence? Were some religious groups more or less tolerant than their counterparts? Were incidents of violence primarily rhetorical, or do they reflect the real volatility of social interactions? How might the literary representation of violence be an act of violence itself or encourage physical violence? This course investigates the intersection of violence and religion from the third through the seventh century C.E., paying particular attention to questions of definition, legitimacy, and the interpretation of violent acts.

By the end of 1804, the white planter class had been killed or exiled and Black men ruled the island. Before it happened, white slave masters could never imagine that tens of thousands of enslaved Africans would one day break their chains and succeed in defeating French, British, and Spanish armies. For millions of enslaved people, the Haitian Revolution proved that the dream of freedom could become reality and inspired slave conspiracies and rebellions from Virginia to Brazil.

To be explicit, though: our object in reading these books is not to learn their subject matter. If you gain a better understanding of these historical events through our readings, great  but that is not the goal of the course. Rather, our aim is to study the discipline of History itself, looking closely at how the historians writing these texts tried to make and discover knowledge. This approach will allow us to grapple with a number of significant philosophical questions that still dominate the study of the past. Is there such a thing as historical truth? Is it appropriate for historians to have a political agenda? What does it mean for a history, or a historian, to be biased? To what extent is history a useful lens for understanding the present?

Their agitation on behalf of 18-year-old Mike Brown, who fatally resisted an overbearing white police officer, virtually brought millions of people to a sleepy suburb.  Browns last stand sparked a democracy movement throughout the country -- in places like Memphis, Baltimore, New York, Dallas, and Minneapolis.  This course will cover the making of a modern freedom movement. The bold action of primarily Black demonstrators provoked Americans to seek answers to three fundamental questions:  what is the precise purpose of policing; who will protect Black youth; and, who is eligible for citizen rights?  In challenging the U.S. police state, young democrats called on people of good conscience to see the overreach of a militarized police force. In Ferguson, many young Black residents, believing that law enforcement was more interested in protecting property and capital than them, moved to protect themselves.  Although they felt justified in destroying the systems that had neglected and abused them, Black youth, as citizens, influenced politics at every level.  In that way, they fortified American democracy by making law enforcement recognize their constitutional rights.

In 1935, W.E.B. Du Bois credited the creation and expansion of public education in the South to African Americans educational activism in the aftermath of slavery. And yet, race has historically delineated access to public schooling, and by extension, economic, political, and civic equality. In this course, we will ask how and why race and educational opportunity have structured and subverted civic inclusion, racial justice, and socio-economic equality.  We will focus on African Americans efforts to secure literacy, schooling, and higher education, with an emphasis on the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. In the first part of the course, we will consider why Americans created a public school system and how race influenced the formation of this critical social institution. Next, we will query how African Americans debated the relationship between education and liberation, particularly after Reconstruction and during the Long Civil Rights Movement. Here, we will focus on African Americans legal and grassroots efforts to advance school desegregation, and the backlash against its implementation in northern and southern cities. Along the way, we will assess the meaning and value of integration, and ask how, why, and to what extent school desegregation has promoted and subverted equal opportunity. Then, we will explore how policy makers have attempted to use education as a social welfare institution, particularly in an effort to redress segregated housing and unequal labor markets. We will trace the relationship between public schools and evolution of the welfare state, and reflect upon the power and limitations of Americans unique dependence on schooling to equalize opportunity. Finally, we will consider how race continues to inform contemporary reform efforts including school choice, Afro-centric education, and school discipline, among others.

        "description": "In this course students learn about the Palestine/Israel conflict by participating in two immersive simulation modules in which they read key texts and represent the positions of various parties to the conflict. In Part 1, The Struggle for Palestine, 1936 simulation, students present arguments to the British \"Peel Commission\" regarding the Arabs and Jews respective needs and demands as they saw them at the time and learn about the origins of the conflict, and the various contacts between the parties and attempts at mediation from the early 1900s till the late 1940s. In Part II, student delegations  examine proposals for a two-state solution beginning from the mid-seventies, as well as alternative visions of a one-state solution and/or other futuristic models. Different groups then put forward proposals based on these or their own ideas. \"Integrative Simulations\" are neither attempts at conflict resolution nor at finding an artificial middle ground between two asymmetric parties. They do not follow a \"Model UN\" or debate format. Rather, they are deep dives into the most difficult and intractable issues. Students will be asked to push beyond their comfort zones to develop an astute understanding of history and the political, strategic, and psychological underpinnings of the conflict. Students will engage in dynamic teamwork and be supported by the instructor as well as external \"coaches.\" Class meeting once per week. Fall semester. Co-taught by Natasha Gill and Ahmad Khalidi. How to handle overenrollment: Students will be randomly selected. Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: This course requires consistent attendance and in-class participation. Approximately 70% of the course will consist of the simulation modules, during which students will engage in dynamic teamwork/negotiations and give oral presentations. Papers will take the form of historically accurate memos, testimonials, political analyses, newspaper articles, negotiated documents. In addition to coursework, there are four principal expectations for this class:    \n\nPushing beyond comfort zones: Students should be ready to push beyond their comfort zones, sometimes even against their inclinations and beliefs, and to deal with this difficult subject. The simulation does not sanitize the conflict  it presents the real issues from the perspective of the actual parties, which means some perspectives will be appealing to students and others objectionable. While this is challenging, students should feel confident that personal one-on-one support is available from both instructors throughout the module, and the process has clear boundaries and an elaborate structure that draws students away from a conflictual perspective based on their own personal views.    \n\nDiscretion and trust: We ask that due to the sensitive nature of this topic and the high tensions around it on campuses around the country, students come to this class willing to keep to strict rules of confidentiality and conduct within the group. This means respecting (even if voicing disagreement with) the rights of students to express their views without being silenced or shamed; not sharing anything peers have said or done in class or in the simulation with anyone outside the class without their consent; not recording any of the process by audio or video; and never posting information about the process on social media or other online platforms. Written materials (in the form of \"role packets\" and simulation scenarios) should not be shared with anyone outside the class, either online or as hard copies.    \n\nClass Participation: Class participation is special in this module because while the preparatory period includes typical class discussions/questions around the readings, during the simulations it takes a different form. Students will each have a particular role with its own set of readings and objectives in relation to their goals and those of their delegations. They will be making a variety of oral presentations: some will be prepared at home and others will arise spontaneously during the course of the module. Students will be expected represent whichever role they take on with integrity, responding to debates by putting forward ideas that authentically reflect their character.    \n\nTeamwork: In an extended, multi-week simulation, students rely on each other a great deal for support, for three reasons: 1) each student holds a different portfolio and a cogent team position can only be devised if individuals combine their knowledge; 2) the simulation takes many twists and turns and participants need to be present as much as possible to respond to these; 3) delegation members will need consistent support thinking through morally (and sometimes emotionally) charged and intellectually challenging issues.",

Further, the course will place considerable emphasis on the interactions between the Cold War conflict and the concurrent process of decolonization. Throughout the course, students will be introduced to current interpretative models and theoretical approaches dealing with the Cold War, as well as read key texts on how the Cold War shaped a range of developments in different societies across the globe. Along with examining the beginning of the Cold War and key conflicts in Korea, Cuba, and Vietnam, we will consider the Cold Wars domestic manifestations in the United States, Soviet Union and beyond.

Despite its transformative impact, few people know much of anything about the people, organizations, or legal issues involved in the struggle. By studying LGBTQ history through primary source materials, students will develop a rich and nuanced historical view of pivotal moments, places, and people from the homophile movement of the 1950s to gay liberation of the 1970s to the anti-sodomy law and gay marriage battles of the 1990s to the transgender revolution of the 2000s. We will examine organizational records, movement magazines, legislative debates, oral histories and prominent published writings while also diving deeply into the LGBTQ press. We will address such topics as the closet, bullying, anti-gay laws, conversion therapy, the lavender scare, police harassment, religious campaigns, employment discrimination, and violence.  Students will learn to identify and work with an archive to craft a major, original research paper or digital exhibition or art installation on some aspect of the LGBTQ Rights Movement in the U.S. history.

This seminar examines how the experience of war during the 1930s and 40s are captured in the memory and history of Japan, East Asia, and the United States. The principal questions guiding our discussions will be: What is the relationship between history and memory in our media-saturated world? How are the memory and history of war intertwined in both national and international politics?  What forms of memory have been included and excluded from dominant historical narratives and commemorative devices? What role can the academic discipline of history play in these controversies?

This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups.

Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity.

Students will work closely with community partners in a compilation of participants' stories and memories about flowers, fruits, and herbs in connection with personal narrations of their transit and previous homes. This narrative component will be followed by research assignments and, finally, the construction and planting of the garden in collaboration with the community partners. The class will also include readings and assignments on migration and refuge, environmental justice and ancestral knowledge, gardening as artistic and political practice, and gardens as monuments and memorials.

How do judicial decisions balance the preferences of the majority and the rights of minorities? Is it possible to reconcile the role that partisan dialogue and commitment play in a democracy with an interest in the neutral administration of law? How does the provisional nature of legislative choice square with the finality of judicial mandate? By focusing on the United States Supreme Court, we will consider various attempts to justify that institutions power to offer final decisions and binding interpretations of the Constitution that upset majoritarian preferences. We will examine the origins and historical development of the practice of judicial review and consider judicial responses to such critical issues as slavery, the New Deal, and abortion. The evolving contours of Supreme Court doctrine will be analyzed in the light of a continuing effort to articulate a compelling justification for the practice of judicial intervention in the normal operation of a constitutional democracy.

This course will take up this claim in relation to the making of the legal subject, the formation of legal institutions, and the work of social transformation.  We will also consider how taking pathology seriously as a critical form, drawing on feminist and disability studies, might allow us to throw into question that which is often normalized through law, for example the purported solidity and desirability of the patriarchal family, or the productivity of capitalist labor.  In the last third of the course, we will take the project of decolonial psychiatry as an extended case study in the relation between psychic forms and legal and political struggles.

Du Bois wrote in 1903, the problem of the twentieth century was the problem of the color-line, racial segregation remains an intractable feature of American life today. This course will begin with the formal dismantling of racial segregation in the mid-twentieth century. Why, despite the historic convergence of grassroots activism, public opinion, and Supreme Court decision making during the civil rights era, does race- and class-based segregation continue to shape American schools, neighborhoods, and parks? What role does law play in producing and maintaining segregation, and how might law be used to mitigate and even reverse it? Are changes to federal law, absent changes to state and local laws, sufficient to achieve integration? What does literary expression reveal about how segregated space is regulated and reproduced, who is implicated in that process, and how to make sense of or combat it? We will begin with landmark Supreme Court cases, including Shelley v. Kraemer (1948), Brown v. Board of Education I & II (1954, 1955), and Milliken v. Bradley (1974), and midcentury literary responses to segregation, including works by Richard Wright, Ann Petry, Gwendolyn Brooks, Lorraine Hansberry, and James Baldwin. We will then consider alternative levers of change, exploring the Black separatist tradition, court cases at the state and local level, innovative approaches imagined by writers and activists, and recent developments that threaten to entrench segregation further. Topics will include redlining and racial covenants, the state action doctrine, the public/private divide, the public square and the public trust doctrine, and redistricting and incorporation.

        "description": "LJST 260 and SWAGS 262 In the twentieth century, American feminist movements made significant strides in securing suffrage, formal equality under the law, reproductive justice, and the possibility of economic independence through paid labor.  And yet, the entry of (some) women into the public sphere has only intensified the urgency of a series of underlying questions: Is it desirable to demand legal transformations in the name of the identity woman, and if so, how should we incorporate considerations of gender and queerness, class, race, ability, and nationality? What is the relation between the formal emancipation of some women and intensified forms of domination of other women, for example, in the sphere of care work? What are the histories, logics, and political economies of these relations?  What is the family, what is its relationship to reproduction, and how should its legal attachments, obligations, and relationships be understood from a feminist perspective? How did individual choice become the privileged legal mechanism for feminist forms of freedom and what is the status of choice today? We will aim to develop our understanding of these distinct but deeply linked questions of feminist thinking and methodology, with an emphasis on American writers and their postcololonial and anti-racist critics, and to appreciate conflicting points of view and longer histories within these debates. Thinkers include Mary Wollstonecraft, Sojourner Truth, Aleksandra Kollontai, Rosa Luxemburg, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Betty Friedan, Catherine Mackinnon, Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Adrianne Rich, Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, Eve Sedgewick, Sylvia Federici, Kimberle Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, Hortense Spillers, Patricia J.

In this course, students will explore the genealogy of these debates and engage with the questions they brought to the fore: what does it mean for Islam to be the religion of the state? Is there a place for Islamic law in the legal systems of these modern states? How have various actors (Islamist movements, Muslim jurists, state leaders, revolutionary activists, etc.) made sense of and competed over the meaning and implications of Islams relationship to the state?

In this course, we will engage with fictional worksboth literature and filmin order to trace how imagining AI has evolved historically. We will also explore legal textscase law, statutes and regulations, and legal scholarshipin order to track how humans have used laws and the legal system to account for the social, political, and economic changes induced, or threatened, by AI. Taking inspiration from the nascent field of Critical AI Studies as well as scholars working in Science and Technology Studies, we will consider AI not solely as technological: instead, we will attend to how cultural work that has imagined AI has conditioned the laws meant to regulate it, and, in turn, how these laws and regulations have conditioned such cultural work.

        "description": "(RESEARCH SEMINAR)  Few twentieth-century intellectuals are as controversial and as influential as the German jurist Carl Schmitt (1888-1985). A prominent critic of liberal democracy during the Weimar Republic (1918-1933), Schmitt generated novel theories of dictatorship, political theology, sovereignty, constitutional law, and emergency powers that were studied closely by all sides of the Weimar political spectrum. Following Hitlers rise to power in 1933, Schmitt joined the Nazi Party and became one of its most prominent legal thinkers, in which capacity he published numerous antisemitic texts. Following the defeat of Nazism in 1945, American authorities arrested Schmitt and permanently banned him from university teaching. Schmitts post-war detention and ban was initiated and led by Amherst College professor Karl Loewenstein (1891-1973), whose 1945 arrest warrant called Schmitt a man of near-genius rating.\" From 1945 until his death, Schmitt published and lectured on topics mainly related to international law, the laws of war, and geopolitics. Today he remains widely condemned for his Nazism and antisemitism, while also being widely regarded as an especially incisive critic of modern legal institutions, theories, and practices. In this research seminar, our primary goal will be to study Schmitts key texts in relation to their political, legal, and historical context. Our secondary goal will be to develop methods for parsing the extensive secondary literature that has emerged on topics related to Schmitt's thought. Along the way, we shall pay special attention to the question of Schmitts complicity with political evil and ask what lessons, if any, Schmitts texts might hold for our own time.

We will begin by reviewing early examples of Law and Literature scholarship in the United States during the twentieth century before charting the development of such interdisciplinary approaches around the world through  today. To accompany our review of the field, we will be engaging with legal texts (statutes, regulations, judicial opinions, treatises, etc.) alongside cultural ones (film, fiction, poetry, etc.) to trace the interplay among these different modes of representation. Over the course of the semester, we will consider the relationships between legal and cultural interpretation, authorship and authority, legal and literary narrative techniques, cultural genres and legal forms, and more.

Individual freedom to create? Something old that your parents listen to? Jazz emerged in New Orleans in the early twentieth century and quickly spread throughout the world, becoming, at certain points in its history, wildly popular, and at others, decidedly esoteric. Jazz has been called, variously: savage, modern, instinctive, sophisticated, revolutionary, a rare national treasure, a secret sonic weapon, noise, America's classical music, and the most powerful evolutionary force in modern music. It has been instrumental in political movements (for instance, the export of jazz ensembles to the Soviet Union during the Cold War); in campaigns both to sanction human rights (Jazz in the Civil Rights Movement), and suppress them (its concerted and systematic effort to exclude women); and it has been used at once to amplify capitalism (the market-savvy Smooth Jazz industry) and to critique it (the efflorescence of independent musician collectives, such as the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians). Using audio recordings, newspaper articles, television programs, and other archival materials, along with recent and past scholarship, we will examine the sounds, key figures, and practices that make up this music to consider what this enduring yet elusive style has to tell us about ourselves.

We will investigate the practice of music composition across recent decades and create original work inspired by the music and techniques we encounter. We will study the use instruments and voices, how to provide a clear musical score for interpretation by performers, and how improvisation and technology can inform and become part of a composition. Students may bring any style or tradition to the table. The class will focus especially on three lineages through the twentieth century into the twenty-first: modern Western art music, instrumental music from the African-American tradition, and the gamut of American popular song. Each composition will be presented in class, with the assistance of performers from inside and outside the class. We will develop the skill of providing one another constructive feedback. The class will culminate in a concert performance of final compositions.Two class meetings per week.

The music we analyze will come from popular, folk, and classical traditions around the world, including West African drumming, Caribbean dance genres, East Asian court and religious traditions, American roots music, classical traditions from the Arab world and Indian subcontinent, and several global popular styles. At its core, the course addresses three questions: What do musicians working in the traditions we study hear in and think about the music they make? What methods are available to better understand these kinds of music? How does analysis develop our skills as musicians and listeners? Students will learn methods of musical transcription (notating or visually representing sound) and software-aided analysis to develop translatable ways of approaching timbre, texture, rhythm, groove, meter, harmony, mode, tuning, and musical form. Understanding the ways people theorize music in the process of performance, improvisation, composition, and teaching across musical cultures will give students new tools for creating, performing, and analyzing music. Although not a performance course, class sessions feature hands-on involvement with instruments and singing. Coursework includes weekly listening, transcription, and analysis assignments; basic projects in composition; and music-making presentations. This is an upper-level musicianship course designed for majors or students with experience analyzing and performing music.

        "description": "(Offered as PHIL 225 and ENST 228) Our impact on the environment has been significant, and in recent decades, the pace of change has clearly accelerated. Many species face extinction, forests are disappearing, and toxic wastes and emissions continue to accumulate. People are being displaced, and even our climate is changing. These are all well-established scientific facts and the prospect of a general environmental calamity seems all too real. This sense of crisis has spurred intense and wide-ranging debate over what our proper relationship to nature should be. This is the focus of the course. Among the questions we shall explore will be: Do animals have rights we ought to respect? Is nature intrinsically valuable or merely a bundle of utilities for our benefit? Is there even a stable notion of what is natural that can be deployed in a workable environmental ethic? What obligations, if any, do we have to future generations? Can there be overpopulation and if so, how many should live on our planet? Do our answers to these questions result in some way from a culturally contingent image we have of nature and our place within it? Is there anything special about the way that we go about appreciating nature aesthetically? How might we best go about changing the ways we inhabit the planet? Limited to 20 students. Fall semester.

They collect taxes, put us in jail, draft us into the army, and tell us what we can and cannot own. In this course, an introduction to Western political philosophy, we seek to understand what, if anything, could justify the state in wielding such extraordinary power over us. We will pursue questions like: Why should I obey the law? Should the state tax the rich and give to the poor? Does the state promote freedom, or threaten it?

In the Critique , Kant addresses themes that cover the full range of human experience: the capacity of the mind to know the world; the nature of space and time; whether free will is possible; the relation between appearance and reality; whether science is compatible with religion; and much more. Holding these topics together is Kants famous doctrine of \"transcendental idealism, which asserts that certain key features of the world actually depend on the existence and nature of our minds.

The idea that the same simple physical laws apply equally well in the terrestrial and celestial realms, called the Newtonian Synthesis, is a major intellectual development of the seventeenth century. It continues to be of vital importance in contemporary physics. In this course, we will explore the implications of this synthesis by combining Newtons dynamical laws with his Law of Universal Gravitation. We will solve a wide range of problems of motion by introducing a small number of additional forces. The concepts of work, kinetic energy, and potential energy will then be introduced. Conservation laws of momentum, energy, and angular momentum will be discussed, both as results following from the dynamical laws under restricted conditions and as general principles that go well beyond the original context of their deduction.

From the Lagrangian formulation we will move to the Hamiltonian formulation and the discussion of dynamics in phase space, exploring various avenues for the transition from the classical to the quantum theory.

What becomes politically possible when \"migration crises\" turn into a constant backdrop to national politics and international relations?

Internationally, crises enable decision-makers to rethink and alter established norms, practices, and structures for cooperation. The course uses an international relations and comparative lens, relying on evidence from around the world. We will examine how states use and abuse migration to advance their agendas (Russia and Belarus weaponize migration to destabilize the EU's eastern border; transit/host countries in the Global South - like Jordan and Turkey - monetize refugees to extract rents; Western governments outsource migration management via cash-for-migrants deals; countries in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe cultivate the migration-development nexus etc.). We will discuss sovereignty, international security, technology and AI implementation, conflict and hybrid warfare, climate change, transnational networks and crime, international law and human rights, globalization and development, global governance, and diaspora diplomacy.

If some Latin American nations have depicted their recognition of gay rights as symbolic of their progressive character, certain North African nations have depicted their repression of homosexuality symbolic of their opposition to western imperialism. The results of sexual politics are often contradictory, with some countries enabling same-sex marriage but criminalizing abortion and others cutting aid in the name of human rights.

The questions that will guide this course are: How has the United States come to this point, and how did we reach the current crisis of democracy? We will also consider whether the present crisis has been precipitated and shaped by our very aspiration to build a racially and ethnically inclusive society. How does that crisis play out in the internet/social media era? And have Americans forgotten what it means to think and act in a democratic fashion? Is the constitutional framework adequate to the challenges the United States now faces?

        "description": "(Offered as POSC 232 and EDST 232) This course surveys some of the principal themes in the political economy of lower-income countries. Questions will cover a broad terrain. What are the key characteristics of poor economies? Why did these countries fail to catch up economically with the West in the 20th century? Who are the key political actors? What are their beliefs, ideologies and motivations? What are their political constraints, locally, nationally and globally? We will review definitions of development, explanations for the wealth and poverty of nations, the role of ideas, positive and dysfunctional links between the state and business groups, the role of non-state actors, the causes and consequences of poverty, inequality, disease and corruption, the impact of financial globalization and trade opening, the role of the IMF and the World Bank, and the arguments of anti-developmentalists. We will look at the connection between regime type and development. (Are democracies at a disadvantage in promoting development?) We will also devote a couple of weeks to education in developing countries. We know education is a human good, but is it also an economic good? Does education stimulate economic growth? What are the obstacles to education expansion? We will not focus on a given region, but rather on themes. Familiarity with the politics or economics of some developing country is helpful but not necessary. Limited to 24 students. Priority given to sophomores. Fall semester. Professor Corrales.

We will explore these themes by reading fictional dialogues, utopian designs, speculative histories, and more.

Key topics will include the history of the state system, anticolonial movements, postcolonial state building, conflict and coexistence in societies with religious and ethnic pluralism, politics of authoritarian regimes, distinctive features of the region's political economy, and dynamics of repression, resistance, revolution, and reform. Among the questions we will address in the course are the following: How did the Middle East emerge as a world region? What political forces have constituted it as such, and what are some of the enduring challenges of defining its scope and distinctive characteristics? Why does the region often appear to be a political crisis factory? Why does it contain so many authoritarian regimes? How do they operate and what explains differences between them? What explains the sources, divergent trajectories, and aftermaths of the Arab uprisings that began in the spring of 2011? Why, how, and with what consequences is sectarian identity mobilized across the region? Course material will include academic research, political analysis from think tanks and research institutes, and public writing from popular media outlets. A central goal is for students to become conversant in current debates about MENA politics and to develop, articulate, and defend their own views on contentious issues.

        "description": "This seminar examines how the digital age (the third industrial revolution) has transformed politics around the world, in democratic and non-democratic contexts. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) change how people, states, and non-state actors interact. Technology creates new access points and vulnerabilities, new windows of opportunity and new politically salient actors, new political behaviors and types of participation. The course includes four modules: e-democracy (online social capital, digital citizenship, hashtag movements, online electoral campaigns, election hacking and \"fake news,\" participation, information/disinformation strategies - e.g. the use of troll farms and bot armies to undermine democratic processes and trust in open societies); cyber security (cyberwar, cyberattacks, defense, terrorism, surveillance, privacy); online revolutions and authoritarian resilience (regime change, democracy promotion, censorship, ); and beyond borders (social movements and hacktivism, crypto currencies, global markets and tech giants, etc.). The course asks four big questions: 1.     How does digital technology transform democracy and democratic politics? 2.     How does the Digital Age influence national and international security? 3.     Do ICTs undermine or strengthen nondemocratic regimes? 4.     What political, economic and social changes occur at the subnational and supranational level as a result of new technologies? We use current issues and cases (e.g. disinformation campaigns/fake news ops, #BlackLivesMatter, #MeToo/#NiUnaMenos, the Arab Spring, online radicalization, the Snowden revelations, net neutrality, Internet centralization & decentralization, Anonymous ops, Internet censorship and surveillance in China, Stuxnet, ransomware cyberattacks, Amazon as a business model, AI, virtual reality etc.) to analyze how cyberspace reshapes politics, societies, markets, communities, as well as political science as a discipline. You will gain a rigorous and sophisticated understanding of the relationship between technology and politics, and its various facets. The course will teach you how to develop expertise and design a research project on a topic of your choice: you will learn how to turn a general interest into a research question; how to read, summarize, and engage with relevant scholarship on the subject; and how to move from reading what others have to say about your topic of interest towards producing new knowledge of the kind that forms the basis for an original research paper or honors thesis.

We explore what professional observations led to the major theoretical ideas in personality psychology, and we critically examine how these ideas have been tested in empirical research.

This is due to several factors: limited material on particular religions, the secrecy of most initiations, and the gradual disappearance of their rich heritage as a result of colonization. This course explores current scholarly understandings of the intricate dances, music, myths of creation, and various rituals associated with African religion, while going further to probe the inner meaning of these external manifestations. We will look in particular at African authors who have elucidated the stories, practices, and symbols of specific religions and revealed their esoteric meaning. Often these practitioners have undergone rigorous initiations and are able to engage the complex relationship between spirituality and practice in their writings. This course will address both the spiritual/mystical aspects of African religions as expressed by these authors as well as the limitations of studying such a topic. Fall semester.

        "description": "The past century and a half have seen Christians engaging capitalism in various ways. Some have argued that capitalism and Christianity are opposed at the level of first principles, with capitalism dedicated to an ethos of competition and Christianity to one of co-operation. Others have argued that capitalism is just human freedom in the sphere of economics, and that the Christians duty is to defend capitalism against threats from those who would dismantle it. Some have argued that Jesus preached the virtue of poverty; others, that he blesses his followers with wealth. This course explores the history of Christian engagements with capitalism since the middle of the nineteenth century. We will examine not only Christian condemnations or valorizations of capitalism (Christian socialism and corporate Christianity), but also engagements that defend some aspects of capitalism while criticizing others (the Social Gospel movement and the Roman Catholic tradition of social thought). We will also examine ways in which capitalism has influenced both church history and Christian theology through discussion of the financial history of Christian publications and institutions, and the recent phenomenon of the Christian corporation.

What about the late Roman world encouraged such violence? Were some religious groups more or less tolerant than their counterparts? Were incidents of violence primarily rhetorical, or do they reflect the real volatility of social interactions? How might the literary representation of violence be an act of violence itself or encourage physical violence? This course investigates the intersection of violence and religion from the third through the seventh century C.E., paying particular attention to questions of definition, legitimacy, and the interpretation of violent acts. As we explore these questions, we will engage with ongoing theoretical discussions about identity, violence, social performance, and boundary construction.

Over the past two thousand years Christian traditions have existed within a wide range of systems of governance. Very few of these have been democratic systems. The history of Christian traditions includes substantive reflections on matters of governance by Christian thinkers and leaders; it also includes substantive engagements between Christian institutions and governments of different kinds. The arrival of democratic governance in the early modern period represented a new condition for Christian traditions, and these traditions have adapted to this condition in a wide variety of ways. Through examination of both ancient and modern materials drawn from both Catholic and Protestant traditions we will survey these adaptations, with particular attention to the question of whether Christianity is a reliable support of democracy, a threat to democracy, or something in between.

By exploring the evolution of the Russian Empire, we will learn about different peoples and cultures in Northern Eurasia. We will also study how imperial states were built and managed, and how they dealt with human diversity reflected in languages, cultures, confessions, etc. Among the problems that will guide our discussion are colonialism and de-colonization, nationalism, diasporas and transnational connections, state-building and wars, citizenship and migration, interethnic conflict and hybridity, the role of religion and religious pluralism in modern politics and society, and impact of modernization on multi-peopled empires. One theme running through the course focuses on how Russian culture, state and institutions were shaped by imperial experiences. One issue for comparative reflection will be how the experience of the Russian imperial formations contributed to shaping the global history course.

This course explores the dramatic history of that experiment from the perspective of those whose lives were deeply affected by the social upheavals it brought about. We begin by examining early visions of the new social order and attempts to restructure the living practices of Soviet citizens by reshaping the concepts of time, space, family, and, ultimately, by redefining the meaning of being human. We then look at how the new human being of the 1920s is transformed into the new Soviet person of the Stalinist society, focusing on the central cultural and ideological myths of Stalinism and their place in everyday life, especially as these myths relate to the experience of state terror and war. Finally, we investigate the notion of life after Stalin, and consider the role of already-familiar utopian motifs in the development of post-Stalinist and post-Soviet ways of imagining self, culture, and society. The course uses a variety of materialsfrom primary documents, public or official (architectural and theatrical designs, political propaganda, transcripts of trials, government meetings, and interrogations) and intimate (diaries and letters), to works of art (novels, films, stage productions, paintings), documentary accounts (on film and in print), and contemporary scholarship.

Through close readings of works by a diverse array of voicesfrom Alexander Pushkin and Leo Tolstoy to Alexander Solzhenitsyn and contemporary figures like Alexei Navalny and Pussy Riotas well as other writers, poets, rock musicians, journalists, and philosophers, we will analyze the complex relationship between artistic expression and political resistance. The course explores several key questions: What motivated these authors to risk presenting politically charged works to the public? Were they fully cognizant of the potential repercussions? We will examine why specific elements of these texts were perceived as threats to contemporary political orders, compare their reception in Russian versus European and North American contexts, and investigate the rationale behind the harsh suppression they faced. The course ultimately addresses fundamental questions about literature's capacity to function as a catalyst for social change: How does literature shape public consciousness? To what extent can it transform individual perspectives? What role does it play in mobilizing political dissent?

As LGBT rights become human rights principles, they not only enter the rights structure of the European Union and the United Nations but are also considered a barometer of political modernity. If some Latin American nations have depicted their recognition of gay rights as symbolic of their progressive character, certain North African nations have depicted their repression of homosexuality symbolic of their opposition to western imperialism. The results of sexual politics are often contradictory, with some countries enabling same-sex marriage but criminalizing abortion and others cutting aid in the name of human rights. This course explores the influence of sexual politics on international relations. We analyze how women and gay rights take shape in the international system, from the UN to security agendas, and evaluate how sexuality shapes the modus operandi of contemporary politics.

How might the category of sexuality act as an additional optic through which to view and reframe contemporary and historical debates concerning the construction of black identity? In what ways have traditional understandings of masculinity and femininity contributed to an understanding of African American life and culture as invariably heterosexual? How have black lesbian, gay, and transgendered persons effected political change through their theoretical articulations of identity, difference, and power? In this interdisciplinary course, we will address these questions through an examination of the complex roles gender and sexuality play in the lives of people of African descent.

        "description": "LJST 260 and SWAGS 262 In the twentieth century, American feminist movements made significant strides in securing suffrage, formal equality under the law, reproductive justice, and the possibility of economic independence through paid labor.  And yet, the entry of (some) women into the public sphere has only intensified the urgency of a series of underlying questions: Is it desirable to demand legal transformations in the name of the identity woman, and if so, how should we incorporate considerations of gender and queerness, class, race, ability, and nationality? What is the relation between the formal emancipation of some women and intensified forms of domination of other women, for example, in the sphere of care work? What are the histories, logics, and political economies of these relations?  What is the family, what is its relationship to reproduction, and how should its legal attachments, obligations, and relationships be understood from a feminist perspective? How did individual choice become the privileged legal mechanism for feminist forms of freedom and what is the status of choice today? We will aim to develop our understanding of these distinct but deeply linked questions of feminist thinking and methodology, with an emphasis on American writers and their postcololonial and anti-racist critics, and to appreciate conflicting points of view and longer histories within these debates. Thinkers include Mary Wollstonecraft, Sojourner Truth, Aleksandra Kollontai, Rosa Luxemburg, Simone de Beauvoir, Frantz Fanon, Betty Friedan, Catherine Mackinnon, Andrea Dworkin, Shulamith Firestone, Adrianne Rich, Angela Davis, Bell Hooks, Eve Sedgewick, Sylvia Federici, Kimberle Crenshaw, Donna Haraway, Hortense Spillers, Patricia J.

As Spains most celebrated film director, Almodovar has created his own cinematic universe. Almodovar lit up Spains movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almodovar has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almodovar films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almodovars ongoing dialogue with Spains social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.

Despite its transformative impact, few people know much of anything about the people, organizations, or legal issues involved in the struggle. By studying LGBTQ history through primary source materials, students will develop a rich and nuanced historical view of pivotal moments, places, and people from the homophile movement of the 1950s to gay liberation of the 1970s to the anti-sodomy law and gay marriage battles of the 1990s to the transgender revolution of the 2000s. We will examine organizational records, movement magazines, legislative debates, oral histories and prominent published writings while also diving deeply into the LGBTQ press. We will address such topics as the closet, bullying, anti-gay laws, conversion therapy, the lavender scare, police harassment, religious campaigns, employment discrimination, and violence.  Students will learn to identify and work with an archive to craft a major, original research paper or digital exhibition or art installation on some aspect of the LGBTQ Rights Movement in the U.S. history.

        "description": "(Offered as SPAN 205 and LLAS 205) Heritage learners of Spanish are students who have grown up speaking, listening, reading and/or writing Spanish with family or in their community. Because of their unique backgrounds, Spanish heritage language learners (SHLLs) are bilingual and bicultural. They function between a Hispanic and an American identity. This fluid and multiple identity can bring challenges, as SHLLs try to fit into both groups. With this in mind, through meaningful activities that focus on students experiences and emotions, this Spanish language course will center on bilingualism, specifically through writing, as a necessary means for identity formation. Because in narrating our stories with others, we enact our identities, this course will include an event open to the community that showcases our voices and talents. Through this course, students will incorporate their personal experience as SHLLs into their coursework. Activities will foster critical thinking, and students will learn to analyze, read, discuss, write, and reflect on issues of language, culture, and identity. Using a student-centered approach, the course will include collaborative brainstorming, free-writing, developing topics of personal importance, and peer and group editing in order to develop students writing proficiency and to build community.

As Spains most celebrated film director, Almodovar has created his own cinematic universe. Almodovar lit up Spains movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almodovar has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almodovar films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almodovars ongoing dialogue with Spains social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States.

It explores how communities form away from traditional places of belonging and national allegiances. We will investigate the distinctions between building community and practicing radical hospitality, examine spaces that welcome these initiatives, and explore practices that give rise to history, memory, and (re)telling for these communities. To examine these issues, the class will build a community garden with \"seeds from the diaspora.\" Seeds migrants have carried with them throughout their journey as memories of where they are from. The following local partnerships will be key: Book & Plow, Center for New Americans, and the Western Asylum Support Network. Students will work closely with community partners in a compilation of participants' stories and memories about flowers, fruits, and herbs in connection with personal narrations of their transit and previous homes. This narrative component will be followed by research assignments and, finally, the construction and planting of the garden in collaboration with the community partners. The class will also include readings and assignments on migration and refuge, environmental justice and ancestral knowledge, gardening as artistic and political practice, and gardens as monuments and memorials.

        "description": "In this course students will learn about the life and myths of Dona Marina, the Indigenous woman enslaved by Hernan Cortes during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire. A genius by many accounts, she served as his translator as she was fluent in Mayan, Nahuatl, and Spanish. Mother of the first mestizo, she has conveniently been viewed as a traitor to the Mexican nation. In the contemporary moment, she at times is seen as a feminist icon of resistance partly through a recognition of her victimhood as a woman who had to navigate multiple empires. We will work to separate fact from fiction by engaging multiple secondary and primary sources. Given her role in the conquest, the course will also serve as an exploration of theories of translation as a putatively empirical and aesthetic project. Conducted in Spanish.

Using the studio as a laboratory, we will learn/revisit fundamentals of moving in and out of the floor with ease, efficiency, and proper alignment. Utilizing the floor and gravity as our dance partners, we will experiment with approaches to floorwork that cultivate groundedness, teach the mechanics of low level movement, and develop the strength, coordination and stamina required. Skill-building will be pursued by traveling across or dimensionally through space (sliding, rolling, going upside down, etc.) while remaining close to the floor. Each class will culminate in phrasework that extends students' ability to seamlessly descend, ascend, and dance along a low-flying continuum. Both codified material and improvisation will be used as modalities for learning. This course may be repeated for credit. Two class meetings per week. A half-course. Limited to 22 students.

        "description": "\"What is acting? Who is a performer? In this course, students develop techniques that they discover and embody, making them their own as they explore acting, identity, and performance theories. Through a combination of critical analysis and practical exercises, students will gain a deeper understanding of the complexities of performance and its impact on both the individual and society. The course encourages students to engage in interdisciplinary approaches to storytelling, challenging them to cultivate a nuanced perspective on how performance shapes culturally specific narratives that resonate with their own identities. A central component of the course is the Ancestor Project, where students create and perform a solo that embodies an ancestor of their choosing. The ancestor project invites students to explore their heritage, using music, text, and innovative performance techniques to bring their chosen ancestor to life. These solo pieces may range from  naturalistic to abstract, offering each student the opportunity to experiment and discover their unique artistic voice. In addition, students will select and rehearse monologues from pre-existing plays to bring them to life. These monologues will serve as a foundational catalyst to explore modern and innovative acting techniques. The course will culminate in a sharing of these prepared pieces, rooted in ethnographic and monologue performances, allowing students to present their work to peers in a supportive and reflective environment. This course is appropriate for students with or without prior experience in acting, and also serves as a foundation for more advanced courses in acting and directing in the department.

Yet for over two centuries that alignment has been contested by theatre artists from the Black diaspora, from Native or Indigenous nations, and from the diverse communities of latinidad . This course centers what one First Nations playwright calls BIPOC takeovers of Shakespeares work. We will ask how these creative adaptations and translations engage histories of racial, cultural, and linguistic violence and loss, and how they weave new stories and experiences of resistance and healing. Topics to be explored include the utility of colonial texts for decolonial futures; the relation of land, language, and literature; the transformation of Euro-American theatre through non-Western artistic practice and ceremony; and the recent development of anti-racist initiatives that challenge and reinvent the study, staging, and teaching of Shakespeares plays.

As LGBT rights become human rights principles, they not only enter the rights structure of the European Union and the United Nations but are also considered a barometer of political modernity. If some Latin American nations have depicted their recognition of gay rights as symbolic of their progressive character, certain North African nations have depicted their repression of homosexuality symbolic of their opposition to western imperialism. The results of sexual politics are often contradictory, with some countries enabling same-sex marriage but criminalizing abortion and others cutting aid in the name of human rights. This course explores the influence of sexual politics on international relations. We analyze how women and gay rights take shape in the international system, from the UN to security agendas, and evaluate how sexuality shapes the modus operandi of contemporary politics.

How might the category of sexuality act as an additional optic through which to view and reframe contemporary and historical debates concerning the construction of black identity? In what ways have traditional understandings of masculinity and femininity contributed to an understanding of African American life and culture as invariably heterosexual? How have black lesbian, gay, and transgendered persons effected political change through their theoretical articulations of identity, difference, and power?

And yet, the entry of (some) women into the public sphere has only intensified the urgency of a series of underlying questions: Is it desirable to demand legal transformations in the name of the identity woman, and if so, how should we incorporate considerations of gender and queerness, class, race, ability, and nationality? What is the relation between the formal emancipation of some women and intensified forms of domination of other women, for example, in the sphere of care work? What are the histories, logics, and political economies of these relations?  What is the family, what is its relationship to reproduction, and how should its legal attachments, obligations, and relationships be understood from a feminist perspective? How did individual choice become the privileged legal mechanism for feminist forms of freedom and what is the status of choice today? We will aim to develop our understanding of these distinct but deeply linked questions of feminist thinking and methodology, with an emphasis on American writers and their postcololonial and anti-racist critics, and to appreciate conflicting points of view and longer histories within these debates.

        "description": "(Offered as SPAN-347, FAMS-328, EUST 347 and SWAG-357) Pedro Almodovar has defined world cinema for the last five decades. As Spains most celebrated film director, Almodovar has created his own cinematic universe. Almodovar lit up Spains movie screens beginning in the 1980s with his confrontational takes on gender, sexuality, religion and family. Now a globally-recognized and award-winning queer filmmaker, Almodovar has matured from his raunchy beginnings in the Madrid punk scene to become a director sensitive to the LGBTQ+ community, marginalized people, and human rights, though he still manages to stir up controversy. In this course, we will consider a panorama of Almodovar films from the 1980s to the 2020s during periods of political, social and cultural transition in Spain. Particular emphasis will be placed on how the director has represented gender identity and sexuality throughout his career. Through weekly screenings, course readings, written assignments and a final video essay, we will work through Almodovars ongoing dialogue with Spains social history and culture, as well as his cinematic legacy throughout Europe, Latin America and the United States. This course is conducted in Spanish, with most readings in English; prior exposure to film studies is not required. Prerequisite: Spanish 301 or permission of instructor.  Limited to 25 students. Fall semester: Professor Brenneis How to handle overenrollment: SPAN, FAMS, SWAG, LLAS and EUST majors first, then by seniority (seniors, juniors, sophomores) Students who enroll in this course will likely encounter and be expected to engage in the following intellectual skills, modes of learning, and assessment: Emphasis on visual analysis, group work, critical analysis of readings, and written work. Instruction and films in Spanish; readings in Spanish and English. Discussion format in which active listening and participation in Spanish is crucial. Assessments include short written responses, graded essays and a final edited video essay.",

        "description": "(Offered as HIST 424 and SWAG 424) The LGBTQ Rights Movement in the U.S. has revolutionized the lives, rights, and representations of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer people in modern life. Despite its transformative impact, few people know much of anything about the people, organizations, or legal issues involved in the struggle. By studying LGBTQ history through primary source materials, students will develop a rich and nuanced historical view of pivotal moments, places, and people from the homophile movement of the 1950s to gay liberation of the 1970s to the anti-sodomy law and gay marriage battles of the 1990s to the transgender revolution of the 2000s. We will examine organizational records, movement magazines, legislative debates, oral histories and prominent published writings while also diving deeply into the LGBTQ press. We will address such topics as the closet, bullying, anti-gay laws, conversion therapy, the lavender scare, police harassment, religious campaigns, employment discrimination, and violence.  Students will learn to identify and work with an archive to craft a major, original research paper or digital exhibition or art installation on some aspect of the LGBTQ Rights Movement in the U.S. history. We will make extensive use of digitized source material while also visiting local archives such as the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College and the Robert S. Cox Special Collections and University Archives Research Center at UMass Amherst. Limited to 12 students. Fall semester. Professor Manion.
